  utter_greet:
  - text: Hello! How can I help you?
  utter_intro:
  - text: First let me introduce myself, my name is BrainBot. I hope to be able to help you prepare for your upcoming interview. I am still in development, and as such, I have some limitations, I may not always understand what you're saying properly, so it would really helpful if you could speak slowly and try to articulate.
  utter_ask_hs:

  utter_ask_passion:
  - text: Can you tell me about anything that you have done that would demonstrate your passion for mechanical engineering?
  utter_ask_interest:
  - text: Please explain which features of the mechanical engineering course at Imperial attracted you and why?
  utter_ask_future:
  - text: Where do you see yourself in 10 years?
  utter_ask_extra:
  - text: Could you tell me about any extra-curricular activities that you were involved in, that demonstrates that you will be a great addition to our student community?

  utter_ask_help:
  - text: Let me know if you're done or if you need help.
  utter_ask_math1:
  - text: Ok, let's see where you got stuck. Did you start by putting the problem into equations?
  utter_ask_math2:
  - text: Please check that your equations are correct. Now you need to identify the minimum of a function. Did you do that?
  utter_ask_math3:
  - text: Let's check that your first derivative is correct. For the final step, you need to take the second derivative. Have you done that?
  utter_ask_math4:
  - text: Let's check your second derivative. This is the last piece of advice that I can give you. Let me know when you're done and ready to give me your solution.
  utter_start_math:

  utter_ask_mathdone1:
  - text: ok, great! Please give me the answer you found to the problem.
  utter_ask_mathdone2:
  - text: Can you walk me through your reasoning?
  utter_ask_no1:
  - text: Why don't you try doing that on your own and let me know if you need extra help?
  utter_ask_no2:
  - text: Try to take the derivative of your function to find the minimum. Let me know if you need help again.
  utter_ask_no3:
  - text: Why don't you keep trying a little on your own and let me know if you need extra help?
