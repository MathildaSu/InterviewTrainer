"The use of mathematics and mechanics to create complex machines from simplistic theories is a wondrous art form, and something I have been passionate about since I was a child.
My discovery and eventual love of engineering came when I would help my dad with the construction of the car garage in our garden.
I was taught how to measure and cut lengths of wood from which I learned the importance of precision and the satisfying pay off from hard work.
This interest quickly grew when I received a K'nex building set for Christmas. I would spend hours every day making toys for my brother and when I had built everything from the instruction booklet I moved on to drawing up and then creating my own constructions.
My flair for technology followed me through school. I would alternate between going to science and computing at break times, trying my hand at program design, animation and presentation, as well as studying the mechanical and electrical sides of physics. By third year I was competent with Newtonian mechanics.
I had created various programs ranging from simpler programs that would take results from acceleration experiments and perform the necessary calculations, to file decompression and editing in number systems such as hexadecimal.
Having done the ground-work for mechanics I was able to invest more time into the more intricate and exciting areas of physics.
I quickly became enamoured by many concepts not included in higher physics, such as the use of electromagnetic force, induction and resonance in tesla coils, how gyroscopic precession and countertorque affects helicopter flight control, and how pascal's principle can be used to create the hydraulic press in a car's brake pad.
When I am not trying to describe the world with maths, I take the time to teach my friends and family about the things I have learned. Particularly with supporting my brother who is now doing his higher exams. I regularly discuss with him any areas of difficulty he has and in the process try to prepare him for more advanced material.
On top of this I often get students coming to me with their maths problems, which has lead to me spending at least a few hours every week helping, and hopefully inspiring, people in their mathematical pursuits.
In my final two years of high school I was a prefect, this entailed making sure students went to their next classes in an orderly fashion and helping lost student find their way around.
Growing up I went to a lot of folk festivals where I became interested in playing violin, with this hobby came a fascination with the mechanics of sound.
Taking the idea of vibrating particles and applying it to learn the concept of pressure waves took me to the marvel of acoustic levitation. I was enamoured by the idea that the maxima points of interference could create a pressure with enough force to make small objects appear as if they are floating.
Outside of school I have a variety of interests, though in particular I enjoy playing my violin in the local orchestra, aptly named Fiddlesticks, filled with people of all age groups and skill levels. Through it I have had the chance to meet a huge spectrum of people.
As I continue my studies through university, it will be my goal to develop my understanding of physics and mathematics so that I can contribute my own ideas to new experimental technologies such as self-driving cars, robotic limbs and autonomous quad-rotor helicopters. On top of this I look forward to prospect of self studying."
"Since leaving school I got an apprenticeship as an electrical engineer at James Fisher Nuclear (formally known as MB Faber).
I have now finished my time and completed an ONC/HNC & HND. I feel that academically I can achieve more and taking a degree is the next natural progression.
James Fisher Nuclear as a company has been incredibly supportive during my further education and my line management have encouraged me to further progress my career with a degree.
I am committed to my career in electrical engineering and aspire to one day become a charted engineer. In order to achieve my ambition the IET requirement state that an accredited masters degree is required.
My personal life range from scouting activities, voluntary work and flying light aircraft.
Scouting has always been a cornerstone of my family with both my mother and brother being scout leaders for many years. After progressing through beavers, cubs, scouts and explorers I am now a scout network member and a beaver scout leader for 8th Fulwood in Preston.
I also devote some weekends to Waddecar scout camp as a crew member providing site service for 4-6 weekends of the year. This voluntary site work ranges from help with electrical systems, keeping facilities clean and tidy, running activities for groups on camp, digging trenches and landscaping. My other voluntary work involves delivering the Duke of Edinburgh award for Lancashire County Council. Having completed the bronze and silver and a presentation short for gold i now assist the D of E team in teaching essential outdoor skills to young people and provide supervision on weekend expeditions.
My main weekend hobby is Aviation. July 2012 I acquired a private pilots license and in February 2013 bought a share of a flying group based at Blackpool airport.
Since starting I have clocked up over 140hours of flying time which includes a night rating and a instrument restricted rating (IR)R.
There is a heavy social side involved with flying with a strong group of us who regularly meet up on a Saturday or Sunday to go touring around the UK for the day. We enjoy visiting new places and are looking to take flight internationally to Ireland and France in the coming months."
"The first fully functional computer ENIAC or Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, spanned over thousand square feet, used eighteen thousand vacuum tubes, and weighed over thirty tons.
A modern CPU however, is a thousand times faster than ENIAC. My curiosity for electronics was initially sparked by computers as it amazed me with its ability to perform billions of calculations in mere seconds.
I was further inspired by the realization that electronics pervaded almost all aspects of modern civilization.
Today electrical engineering forms the underpinning of modern technology and what fascinates me the most is its applicability in real life systems. The breadth of the subject and its rapid advancement makes it a very exciting and relevant field.
Pursuing an engineering degree has exposed me to the challenges that lie in electrical engineering. I found that designing digital circuits and analysing the behaviour of electronic devices to be particularly demanding.
However at the same time it has fuelled my interest in digital communication systems as well as micro-electro-mechanical systems or MEMS. The scope for miniaturization of electrical and mechanical systems to micrometre scales is very appealing.
I find it intriguing that these extremely small systems can cause effects on a macro scale, such as the ability to steer an aircraft by placing tiny actuators on the wings of an aircraft. Apart from these subjects, vector calculus and complex analysis were very interesting topics.
The applications of complex analysis in electrical engineering is significant, and a thorough familiarity with it has made it easier for me to understand several electrical courses.
Supplementing my university courses, I took an online course on audio and music engineering offered by Coursera. I chose this course as it merged my interest in music with engineering and provided me with an opportunity to explore a hands on approach to engineering. The course taught me the basics of acoustics and amplifiers, and as part of a project build a guitar amplifier.
The course was rewarding as I was able to apply several concepts that I had learned in university as well as understand how electronic circuits were designed. It also helped improve my independent study skills.
To be informed of the current trends and advances in technology, I regularly read the R&D magazine, electronic design newsletters, and occasionally the IEEE journals. I believe it is vital for engineers to be acquainted with the advancements in several fields to have a well-rounded perspective on emerging technologies.
I was the general secretary of the university student council during my second year. Along with detailed planning and budgeting of university events, most of my time was spent on persuading and motivating my fellow council members to carry out necessary tasks. These responsibilities have markedly improved my communication, organizational, and leadership skills.
I found that effective time management was critical to balance my commitments. To contribute to the student culture at the university, I cofounded Kairos, a social entrepreneurship club.
I believe that entrepreneurship can be an effective tool to solve problems that affect society. Kairos provides a platform for such entrepreneurs, and offers workshops and talks by guest lecturers.
Building a club from the ground up was challenging, and it required a team effort to recruit members, raise awareness of social issues, schedule events, and raise funds for the club. The experience has taught me valuable decision making and team management skills.
In the future, I wish to undertake research in the field of MEMS, and hopefully contribute to the growth of technology. The research opportunities in the UK coupled with state of the art facilities have supported world class research in engineering. I believe that pursuing a degree from your institution will equip me with the necessary skills and confidence to achieve my goals."
"The interest I have in engineering started with my fascination in Science. While I was growing up, it has always been my desire to be involved in a scientific project; and when the opportunity came, I did not let it go to waste. In Singapore, my science research partner and I presented our project on Titanium Dioxide Nanotubes Water Purifier to Nobel Prize winners.
The project was more than a nanotechnological twist to a water purifying system - it unveiled the basic skills of an engineer that I have within me: of being creative and innovative, of being able to work as a team and of being able to communicate and present ideas coherently.
Professor Jerome Friedman, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1990, was impressed with the innovative approach I applied in the project and without any doubt; I am convinced that career in engineering defines me.
I consider myself to be fortunate to not let geographical boundaries prevent me from my pursuit for knowledge, but I believe what is even more fortunate is to have an expert in the engineering industry for a father to be able to ask and discuss on engineering breakthroughs such as the generation of clean energy from osmosis in Norway.
I have gained insightful work experience at my father's engineering firm, MTD Capital Berhad, where I had the opportunity to apply my studies in Physics to understand the applications of pressure and damping in machines.
It was captivating to witness how engineers from different fields collaborate on a construction site to solve problems, and I certainly feel that I can adapt well to a working environment that requires teamwork.
Besides, the commitment shown by engineers in maintaining safety standards in projects has made me realise the importance of pioneering new techniques and keeping up with the latest innovative ideas to deal with greater problems in the future.
Apart from my science project, my active participation in engineering-related activities has constantly spurred my enthusiasm for engineering. In the Mighty Minds Challenge, I successfully applied the Laws of Conservation of Energy to complete a given task.
Through this, I discovered that resourcefulness is truly a quality to be admired among engineers, especially when designing ingenious solutions to problems without jeopardising safety and environmental aspects.
A robotics competition I recently participated in taught me how to think analytically like an engineer. Not just that, I obtained valuable hands-on experience in and exposure to designing and programming, which I believe will be advantageous later in my engineering course.
I am confident that my A-Level studies will equip me with the fundamental knowledge and skills needed to pursue a career in engineering. Physics, which is my favourite branch of science, continues to fascinate me with the principles and theories that define the scientific laws of the universe.
Economics gives me a sense of appreciation to the business environment that engineers work in. Mathematics, on the other hand polishes my thinking skills, which I put to good use in Further Mathematics when solving more challenging questions.
I am active not just inside classrooms, but outside as well. I enjoy playing rugby as much as I love playing the drums.
Rugby taught me how discipline can be applied in life, from performing in my school orchestra to living independently in a boarding school. Being a good team player has allowed me to be a good team leader.
An achievement that documents my leadership ability is my high school magazine, in which I was entrusted as the Editor in Chief. The whole experience taught me the importance of accepting ideas from others and how to manage time efficiently; two values which will be essential in my career.
I am inspired, motivated and determined to pursue engineering in the UK, with a belief that the interest which started from a simple science project will turn into an undying passion and a lifelong profession."
"Mechanical engineering is where all other branches of engineering originate from.
There was an article in New Scientist about a company called Biomechatronics Research Group, which is researching techniques of getting living nerves to grow around and interface directly with prosthetic limbs.
This incredible technology is being developed jointly by biologists and mechanical engineers.
A project can enable you to be at the cutting edge of biology or on the cutting edge of space transportation developing the SABRE engine for the Skylon space plane. I want to have this broad understanding of engineering that allows me to work on such a variety of projects.
At college, the subjects that I enjoy the most are physics and mechanical maths as a lot of the work involves solving complex problems by applying mathematical and scientific principles to them. It is very satisfying when you get to the answer, very much like solving a puzzle.
This is what drew me to engineering; at its core it is solving problems. During an engineering Headstart course at the University of Cambridge that I attended, a particular talk by Tony Purnell the current head of technical development of the British cycling team stuck with me.
He explained that the body weight of the cyclists is kept as low as safely possible, as a single kilogram can make a 20 minute difference in certain uphill races; due to their weight being the largest force that they need to overcome on uphill sections. Not even humans are safe from engineers when they have a problem to solve.
In addition, I also attended a month long Nuffield research placement at Glyndwr University.
The local Toyota engine plant wanted the university to create a VR training simulator to train their employees to use a forklift truck; this was the project that I was involved with.
The project required effective teamwork and time management; there was a great deal of work to be done and a tight timescale to do it.
This greatly developed my ability to work as a team, an essential skill for an engineer. I am currently in the process of getting our research assessed for a gold CREST award.
Looking for more experience with mechanical engineering, I went on work experience at Ricardo, a prototype vehicle design and development company. I was involved with finding engine variables that affected cylinder pressure on an engine, to see if reducing it would prevent a crack forming on the piston skirt.
I also showed them how to create a 3D model of the piston using photogrammetry; one of the methods I researched for capturing real world objects on my Nuffield research placement. They were very interested in this technique are currently doing more research into it.
I have already begun to develop skills that would make a good engineer. Many of these skills have been developed through my time working at Glasfryn Parc, an outdoor adventure centre; I have been working there part time for over 18 months and I am both a go kart marshall and an archery instructor.
A lot of my work involves me teaching customers how to use potentially dangerous equipment; naturally this greatly developed my communication skills and made me a more confident public speaker, I also have basic practical mechanical skills as I often carry out basic repairs to the go karts.
Outside of work, I develop other useful skills through being an active member of my college. I was re-elected as my class’ representative on the college council for a second year and I am a voluntary librarian. Both require me to be responsible over important decisions and actions.
I have both the practical experience and academic ability to have the best possible start in developing myself as a professional engineer. We live in a rapidly developing world on the brink of major change, the possibilities of what I could be involved with in my lifetime excites me."
"My insatiable desire to solve problems fuels my interest in engineering. Throughout my life I have had a distinctly inquisitive approach to technology.
For example, when I was 11, I was bought an Internal Combustion Engine Model. I constructed it as quickly as I could, full of anticipation, but was disappointed when I switched on the ignition to find it not working.
This failure was pivotal in inspiring me to want to study engineering as I spent hours examining the model engine searching for the cause, finally revealing that I had connected the pistons to the crank shaft incorrectly.
Though this event did not involve any particular expertise, it was crucial in stimulating my interest in STEM subjects throughout my education, preparing me with advanced knowledge of mathematics and physics which I hope to apply to far more complex and fascinating problems in the field of engineering in the future, with the hope of one day solving some of the world's most pressing challenges.
Having mined all the resources available on i-want-to-study-engineering.com there is no doubt in my mind that engineering is the vocation for me.
Through studying an array of mathematics modules I have become an adept, versatile mathematician, particularly enjoying Mechanics 2 due to the demanding, yet applicable nature of the content in comparison to the more simplistic mechanics in my Physics AS Level.
The sheer diversity of Physics itself has made the subject most testing and absorbing and as a result, Mechanical Engineering has become the focus of my attention. This, coupled my interest in the Contemporary Conflicts and Challenges topic in my Geography A2, led me to concentrate my EPQ on the future of Defence Technology and Modern Warfare.
My rigorously numerical AS-Levels have made my problem solving technique strictly methodical, which has benefited me thus far, reflected by my high modular marks in all exams. However I was fascinated by the concept of ‘back of the envelope’ workings when reading ‘Remaking the World’ by Henry Petroski.
This described moments when engineers would originate ideas which contained some aspect of ingenuity and defied standard conventions; through my study of engineering I hope one day to be able to achieve this.
I also believe engineers should not be driven by public attention, so to me Nikola Tesla's modest career makes him the true embodiment of engineering. Despite his supreme intellect and role in the creation of momentous inventions, such as the induction motor, Tesla is yet to receive his deserved public recognition.
Transferable skills are crucial in an industrial environment as engineers are constantly interacting with other professionals. Through running a STEM club at a local primary school I became an official STEM Ambassador, giving me the chance to attain skills such as presenting to an audience and the ability to communicate effectively with others.
I have recently applied to Siemens for work experience in 2015, and have been granted that opportunity. As I am intrigued by all aspects of engineering from Mechanical to the relatively new and developing Biomedical Engineering, I hope to refine my understanding of the different factions of engineering through this placement, and at university I wish to study the fundamentals of general engineering to broaden my knowledge as I am yet to decide which specialty I am best suited to.
Over the past few years I have held a variety of jobs in pubs and at school. Whilst not offering much in the way of intellectual challenges, these have helped me develop valuable time management skills and demonstrate my work-ethic.
It is these attributes, along with those I have mentioned previously, that I wish to apply to my further study and I hope that my chosen Universities reflect the talented, ambitious and disciplined individual that I am."
"I want to conquer the world of automobiles by becoming an automobile specialist.
With such plans I have always enjoyed studying more technical topics in physics such as electromagnetism. Apart from it being an engaging topic, motors played the role of an engine in all my toy cars so the curiosity was there from the beginning.
After getting an A* in O levels physics I felt highly encouraged and tried to broadened my knowledge of automobiles.
After spiking through the motor effect I started studying about cars predominantly about engines. Studying about camshafts was really appealing to me especially those small bumps on it which is what made it successfully operate valves in the engines.
Movement of pistons also grabbed my attention especially how combustion of fuel pushed it down which it turned rotated the crankshaft. This whole mechanism was so interesting that I decided to make a small home-made engine.
With both the shafts ready my next goal is make a piston which I find pretty challenging as I have to make sure the explosion in it doesn’t burn the inner core of my piston.
From a young engineer’s perspective I have always taken part in technical and challenging projects. Leading a three-person team to make a dc motor from the tools provided was interesting as apart from testing my physics knowledge it also whetted my leadership and teamwork skills which are very vital when later on in career leading a group of young engineers in a project.
I also went solo in making a simple electric circuit with knitting needles which was the reason I won the top place in that experiment back in school.
My most interesting task was to mechanically modify a toy car by attaching a pair of motors to it. Consequently I have earned the reputation of a mechanic in my house and have fixed many faulty electrical appliances with safety precautions.
From faulty irons to small remote controlled toys. One of my exciting tasks this summer includes making few small wooden lamps from discarded toys which I have successfully completed.
Moreover to acquire some work experience I signed up with few of my friends to visit an engineering college where we were taken to projects assigned to young engineers such as making a small robot.
Seeing those navies assigned to such an engaging task was so moving that it further whetted my decision to embark on a Mechanical Engineering career.
Having engaged myself with such tasks has given me knowledge of the inner mechanisms of such devices and has sharpened my problem solving ability. It has been an interesting experience which has given me an insight on what problems do engineers encounter while fixing more complicated machineries.
Moreover I have opted to study further mathematics which will enlighten areas in maths which may possibly come in handy while studying about machines at university level.
Apart from academics, I am an all-round sportsman and enjoy playing cricket. Sports are a vital facet of my life; it has made me fitter over the years. Having jumped through a ring of fire on a sports day has also me enjoy gymnastics.
Competing with different people in various sports has eventually boosted my confidence, has made me competitive and an easy-going person which is very much essential when different engineering students from differing backgrounds are grouped together to work on a task in universities, such qualities eradicate any self-imposed barriers such as shyness.
Leading my cricket team on in some tough matches has made me decisive and has given me self-belief in my abilities.
With persistent attitude and with unconquerable passion I am on board for this ambitious and thrilling ride."
"When I was part of a team designing a Paralympic wet suit for the National STEM challenge, I thoroughly enjoyed researching materials, designs and working as a team to overcome the challenge.
From this I recognised the important role which engineers play in improving the quality of people's lives, and it was this experience in Year 8 that inspired me to want to pursue engineering.
During a lecture on free-standing arches and cables at an Oxford University taster day, we were introduced to the use of mathematical techniques, such as calculus, to model real situations like the curve of an arch and balancing the forces applied to it.
This was a fascinating experience. I saw how the maths and mechanics I learn in class are put to use in industry. I later read an article about this in the Physics Review, which again proved that a strong basis in maths was used to model forces on civil projects.
My love of mathematics and physics confirmed my desire to take engineering to a higher level. My interest in structures led me to an Extended Project on the design and construction of tall buildings focused on the structural significance of the Burj Khalifa, Dubai. This allowed me to develop my extended writing and critical evaluation skills which I had already gained from AS History.
My research included several books and papers, particularly 'The Evolution of the Buttressed Core' by W.F. Baker, an associate at the architectural firm which designed the Burj Khalifa.
I was interested to discover the ways in which the problems of various forces were reduced, including gravitational load and torque. Wider bases, buttressed cores and 'Y' shaped axes were all used allowing a building to increase its height, yet still be stable. I found this article stimulating as it demonstrated to me how far engineers had come from old techniques such as pre-fabricated steel frames.
In summer 2015 I was an intern for a week at Selex ES, an international leader in engineering, participating in several design tasks. One mechanical project analysed the best solution for a suspended camera at a stadium. This involved resolving forces and discussing tests which are used to select materials.
I designed and soldered a printed circuit board with microphone and LED display, and constructed a casing for a discrete sound sensing device to hold it. I learned how these principles were scaled up, by sectioning functions into discrete circuits. This has major applications in aeronautics, such as creating sensors for electronic warfare instruments and 'black boxes' in our cars.
In summer 2014 I work shadowed at Kiln Flame Systems, which designs industrial rotary kilns. From observing a senior designer I grasped the basic functions of SolidWorks 3D CAD System. Unsupervised and with only basic system knowledge, I created a 3D model of one of my favourite feats of engineering, Concorde.
Taking part in the UKMT Maths Challenges and the Cambridge Chemistry Challenge, achieving highly in all, helped me to hone my problem solving and critical thinking skills.
As Head Boy, as well as presenting many speeches to the school community, I lead the student council, run independently of staff, and effectively delegate tasks to a large cohort of prefects, demonstrating my leadership skills. Outside school, as a long-standing member of a youth theatre group and choir, I gain great satisfaction contributing to a performance and enjoy working in a group towards a final production.
I have a passion for French, recognising the importance of international communication in today's global society, so I am independently pursuing my French post-GCSE and wish to continue this at university.
I believe mankind is driven by innovation and change, and that my proven passion for maths and science can be used to engineer projects which will benefit society in the future. I know that engineering will provide me with a wide-ranging and valuable skill-set for both work and life."
"As a young child I would often marvel at a feat of engineering, such as how a wing creates lift.
However, frustrated at my inability to comprehend the nature of such sights I could merely only scratch at the surface.
More recently my A level studies have equipped me with some of the tools required to deeper my understanding and question why things happen. I have used my mechanics knowledge to investigate the working of centrifugal clutches and rotary vane pumps.
Exploring deeper has thrown up plenty of questions such as how PLCs can utilise logic to control these machines, and it is perhaps my underlying curiosity which draws me to engineering.
As the combination of maths and sciences to solve problems and improve existing systems, engineering has shaped the world we live in. Realising this, my aim is to become a professional engineer entrusted with the responsibility of designing the world for future generations.
My passion for maths has driven me to achieve two silver and one bronze UKMT awards and a silver award in a Physics Olympiad. I enjoy testing myself in these competitions and plan to maintain my mathematical knowledge this year by preparing for STEP examinations and working as a private tutor for current students next year.
Studying mechanics has introduced me to problem solving in real-world situations, such as analysing the forces within a structure, and has driven my decision to study mechanical engineering.
Attending an engineering masterclass I was able to understand how a wing creates lift, in terms of streamline curvature and pressure gradients, and the reasons which disprove some common misconceptions.
It was surprising to learn how common these misconceptions can be, given the potential significance a misunderstanding could have.
I am currently on a work experience placement at Westinghouse Electric Company, manufacturers of nuclear fuel. It has been thoroughly interesting to see the engineering processes which take place, as well as other supporting operations which are important to any engineer such as risk management.
I have seen how machines including 3 phase motors and gearboxes are implemented on the production line, and then used circular motion to solve the gearbox problem, as well as others, on iwanttostudyengineering.org.
It has been satisfying to see processes I have learnt about at A level, such mass spectrometry put into practice on a helium leak detection unit.
Researching single acting cylinders, which I first observed being applied on the production line, has sparked my interest in internal combustion engines, in particular the knowledge I gained on Bernoulli’s equation at the masterclass was useful when trying to understand how a carburetor works.
I have also been exposed to operations management, reading 'Toyota Kata' I learnt about the need for continuous improvement for manufacturers to remain competitive and it was interesting to compare 'Toyota's way' to what I see daily on site. This is something I may want to pursue further after University.
This summer I taught myself some simple programming with python, and appreciated being able to learn something new and quickly test my understanding. I watch 'Big, Bigger, Biggest' documentaries, taking inspiration from the revolutionary breakthroughs that have been made.
One of my favourite engineers is Filippo Brunelleschi, architect of the Duomo, his ingenious ideas were years ahead of his time and are still visible to see.
I also regularly read 'Professional Engineering' magazine to keep up to date with some of the challenges facing current engineers, I recently learnt that Audi are developing a new energy recovery system from potholed roads, and I am excited by the environmental benefits this could have.
I play rugby in my spare time and have recently completed my Gold Duke of Edinburgh award, particularly enjoying the volunteering section where I sold Christmas cards to raise money for charity. Studying engineering will be a gratifying experience, allowing me develop holistically and I look forward to getting started."
"My fascination with functioning mechanisms and their movement began at a very young age.
As a child, I spent a large portion of my free time meticulously taking apart and putting back together my Lego vehicle kit, intrigued by how different combinations of simple building blocks could create such intricate and complex models.
However, much to my disappointment, they always required the direct input of my own energy for them to operate. This obsession with building moving structures remained with me throughout my education; with every passing year increasing my knowledge in both math and physics, whilst continuously driving my passion to understanding engineering.
I have always been deeply interested in both maths and physics; the two core foundations for modern day engineering. I am grateful to have had incredible teachers for both of these subjects throughout my years at school, as their passion has passed down to me.
Physics has always been the subject I am most confident in, whilst maths; after solving a challenging problem, has been the most rewarding.
However, the areas that overlap, such as kinematics and mechanics, are the ones that I have consistently enjoyed and excelled at. In addition to these core subjects, my firm understanding of chemistry has allowed me to make sense of the scientific theory and how it applies to the real, practical world.
Furthermore, my interest in history has developed and refined my analytical techniques. History has taught me to argue my own perspective and to not necessarily accept everything that I have been given, but to continuously challenge and question it instead.
However, I believe that it is equally important that the modern engineer does not only excel academically, but in other personal qualities as well.
Leadership is a trait which I have always possessed; being made both Deputy House Captain and Events Manager in school during my A-Levels has allowed me to hone this skill.
Additionally, playing the guitar for over 8 years and performing in numerous concerts has taught me perseverance, self-expression and has ingrained in me a driving sense to accomplish what I am passionate about.
Furthermore, the time I spent trekking through the Borneo rainforest whilst undergoing my Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award has not only allowed me to develop skills in both teamwork and communication, but to experience a sense of camaraderie; one that I see as vital to accomplishing the task at hand, and therefore, one that I wish to emulate between my peers in both university and in my future.
Despite English being my first language as well as the language of instruction throughout my entire academic life, growing up in Brunei has given me a fond appreciation for the native tongue.
My proficiency in Malay has allowed me to receive an A in my IGCSE's and has built on my confidence and self esteem.
Certainly this language proved useful during my part time job in a local photography shop, where some of the customers had difficulties in speaking English.
Operating in a business environment, and being able to learn through seeing and physically doing whilst in the shop has provided me an invaluable educational experience.
As I have been in an international school since kindergarten, constantly being surrounded by people - both teachers and students alike - from a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, is something I am very much used to.
Being able to study and grow up in this environment has broadened my horizons and allowed me to progress and develop my skills whilst working in a team.
It is my ambition to earn an undergraduate degree from your university as a stepping stone to a successful career in Mechanical Engineering, I look forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead of me."
"Numbers, numbers, numbers. We use them to quantify everything.
Reynolds number can tell us about the state that a flow is in. Avogadro’s number tells us how many atoms or molecules are in one mole.
However, there are far more complex things that, in my opinion, cannot be quantified solely based on numbers. I believe that the human potential is a prime example of something that is unquantifiable via the traditional means. I’m here to tell you why I believe mechatronics is the ideal path for me. During this time think of me as an individual telling you about his journey.
As I progressed throughout my degree, I discovered that I was leaning towards the programming and control systems aspect of mechanical engineering.
When I was introduced to programming, I loved the fact that I could use it to automate many tedious tasks, it felt like I had my own personal virtual butler. The first thing that came to my mind was “how could I possibly introduce programming to a physical system?” and that’s when I learnt about control systems and Arduino.
The more I learnt about control systems the more I realised how prominent it was in our everyday lives and equipment. I began to notice things that I would have otherwise dismissed; the overshoot in the desired velocity output when using the cruise control system in my car or the settling time required for the ambient light sensor of my laptop to achieve an appropriate brightness.
Curiosity got the better of me, and so I decided to buy an Arduino starter kit to teach myself the basic principles of integrating software with hardware.
Everything started to merge together as a series of inputs and outputs programmed and controlled to behave in certain ways. It was then that I discovered my interest in mechatronics. To me mechatronics blurred the boundaries between engineering disciplines and was the next logical step in the evolution of engineering.
Problems. Most people hate them; however, I thrive on solving them. Finding efficient solutions to problems is what engineering is all about, and it is precisely what we do in our projects. When it comes to projects I always make sure to exceed expectations. Projects give me a chance to demonstrate my knowledge and they also give me a chance to find my weaknesses within the topic.
ur Senior Design project was about Structural Optimisation Inspired by Natural Structures. During this project, we conducted parametric studies on many natural structures. At first, we were manually modelling the structures and then using FEA to analyse them; it was painstakingly slow and inefficient.
Therefore, I decided to program a code that automatically generates the structures with the desired parameters. Thankfully all the hard work paid off, and our project was recognised as the best Senior Design Project within the mechanical engineering department.
Studying at AUS gave me the breadth of knowledge and the flexibility to choose my courses. It helped me develop into a well-rounded individual and gave me insight to the many other majors out there. However, I felt that it lacked the depth of knowledge. I always found myself reading additional mechanical engineering books on my own to satiate my thirst for knowledge.
I also felt that the American System focused too much on standardised examinations rather than on the projects of the students. It held me back. Most of the students focused on the exam material and understanding how to use equations to solve standard questions. I couldn’t do that.
I needed to know why and how the equations were derived. I would focus too much on the “unimportant” aspects of the course and I wouldn’t achieve the grades I wanted. However, I shined when it came time to work on our projects. That’s where I was able to apply all the “unimportant” knowledge that I’ve gained, and that’s what I was renowned for. To me, grades are yet another number, and they don’t define a person’s potential or knowledge.
During my senior design project, I was continuously baffled when I saw many recurring numerically optimised structures recurring in natural structures without any human intervention. The structures that we meticulously calculated were already there in many natural structures out there. This experience opened my eyes to the potential of integrating nature into engineering. The University of Leeds has multiple projects doing just that!
The two projects that sparked my interest the most where the projects involving rehabilitation robotics for amputees and Dr. Jordan Boyle’s Project on neuromechanical mechanisms underlying C. elegans locomotion. The University of Leeds offers many optional modules specifically related to those projects in particular the Bio-Inspired & Computing Module and the Biomechatronics & Medical Robotics Module. I hope that I will be able to learn more and to be given the chance to exploit what nature has to offer us at the University of Leeds.
Thank you very much for your time and I hope that you will consider my application. If you have any questions I will be more than happy to answer them and showcase some of my projects in an interview."
"Growing up, my parents put a lot of pressure on me to become a doctor. However, the field was never one that I took to.
From a young age, I was always interested in how machines used in everyday life such as phones and cars worked.
Thus engineering was a field I thought was perfect for me. I used to try building devices to solve everyday problems and while they were not particularly successful, the failures made me eager to learn more.
Playing a lot of racing games in my youth made me particularly interested about cars. It made me do a lot of research about what makes a car perform better.
I would ask my dad about his car and try to help him with repairs. Learning how and internal combustion engine worked brought about questions such as, ""why do most supercars use v8 engines and what makes them better than the usual two or four cylinder engine?” This furthered my interest in engineering.
Engineers have always been the greatest innovators of modern times. Edison with the light bulb; the Wright brothers with the plane; Tesla with electricity and the electric motor.
Such engineers have inspired me to pursue a career in engineering and hope to one day make an impact on the world as they did. Reading “Physics of the Impossible” by Michio Kaku made me realise how much is yet to be invented and how engineers can make them possible.
Maths and physics are subjects I have enjoyed throughout my school life and as a result, have excelled in them. In particular, the mechanics modules of maths are ones that I revel in. I liked using the complex mathematics that I learned and applying them in real-world problems and situations.
In year 12, I attended a physics practical school in QMUL. There, I learnt the practical skills needed for a career in physics or engineering.
I gained first-hand experience of how practicals at university level are carried out; that there is more to the procedure than just doing the experiment itself.
I also improved my teamwork and written and verbal communication. Taking chemistry at AS helped further my scientific understanding and improved my written communication. It also deepened my knowledge of nuclear physics.
Engineers require a wide variety of skills to succeed. Leadership, communication, teamwork just to name a few. I have leadership qualities as I was appointed as captain of my school football team. I also achieved a sports leaders level 2 award.
I volunteer every week at IntoUniversity as one of the mentors in their Primary Academic Mentoring programme. This has allowed me to communicate with people of different levels and not just peers and superiors. At the SPW Science Summer School, I was a student ambassador for physics.
I was tasked with guiding and speaking to important guests and helping out in workshops for my subject. As part of a team of student ambassadors, we had to make sure everything ran smoothly.
Having completed GCSE Arabic and growing up in a Bengali speaking household has improved my ability to communicate with people of different background and cultures.
Outside of my studies, I am a dedicated sportsperson. I play football for my local club and for the school team. I also join in other sports wherever I can; I was part of the cricket and athletics team in secondary.
I have done a lot of voluntary work for the charity LiC where I ran sports sessions for young people in the community.
Other than sports I enjoy reading, not just about my subject. Most recently I have read “And the Mountains Echoed” by Khaleid Hosseini
I believe a degree in engineering from your university will be the first step for me to a successful career in engineering. Hopefully it will lead to my dream of making an impact on the world and changing it for the better."
"I am naturally curious, often reading articles from howstuffworks.com, New Scientist, The Engineer and various journals. In year 11, I organised two weeks of work experience at Southampton University's High Voltage Lab and ORC, shadowing Ph.D. students.
Here, I realised that whilst science discovers our world, its applications by engineers are of greater interest to me. My first experience of Engineering was with GCSE Systems and Control. I chose to design, build and test a remote controlled robotic arm from scratch.
It gave me an insight into basic prototyping. Designing and building the PCBs and mechanics felt intuitive. Programming PICAXE chips and producing basic CAD drawings was compelling. I want to pursue Engineering at university because it bridges my love of conceptual sciences with the pragmatic world.
Physics this year has been engaging and I am keen to study material composites, fluid behaviour and thermodynamics at university, partly due to my interest in F1 racing.
A-Level Maths has come alive for me with its practical uses, I enjoyed deriving models and then using vectors and trigonometry to calculate, for example, the angle at which objects land when dropped from a plane.
Decision Maths showed me Critical Path Analysis, providing an insight into how engineers plan projects from stadiums to smartphones.
Programming in AS Computing was exciting; I loved learning the language and developed an ability to solve problems with limited tools. Studying costs and benefits, markets and money flow in Economics has allowed insights into engineering issues through the eyes of an economist.
In March 2013, I was selected for the Honeywell Leadership Challenge Academy at the NASA USSRC, Alabama, to join 125 students from 30 different countries.
We learnt leadership skills such as assertiveness, through inspiring talks by NASA shuttle Captain Robert Gibson, propulsion entrepreneur Tim Pickens and others; we used these skills in simulated NASA shuttle missions, heat shield design challenges, debates and even jet fighter simulators. I won the communication award for excellent teamwork.
Engaging with an international cross section of like-minded students was a rare treat and I look forward to an environment like this at university.
This summer, I enjoyed working for Dr. Dina Laila at the University of Southampton, learning about Control theory with Mechanical Engineering interns.
I learnt to use MATLAB, Simulink and Laplace Transforms to mathematically model dynamic LTI systems and perform tests to manage Transient Response, Steady-State Error and Stability. She explained that Engineers have to cope with uncertainty, for example, transfer functions describing a robotic arm can become obsolete due to wear.
For me, these problems make engineering more exciting. Seeing the SR71 Blackbird in the Smithsonian Aerospace Museum last year made me curious about aerodynamics which led to me reading 'the Simple Science of Flight'.
Later, visiting the Mercedes factory in Stuttgart and watching 'How It's Made' daily reaffirmed my desire to study Mechanical Engineering with a focus on manufacturing. Outside academia, I have completed my Bronze Duke of Edinburgh and am due to complete Silver. I volunteered at a charity cafe during year 12 and learnt more about how a business operates.
Being a member of my school debate team and a keen public speaker, I care about world affairs. I was in the Yearbook committee as editor and Chairman of my school council in Secondary School and attended Student Parliament in sixth form.
Playing tennis or badminton is my way of unwinding. I enjoy a healthy social network at college and love interacting with people.
My commitment to study engineering is strong and driven by a passion for learning more about the world. I'm determined to pursue innovative engineering in the future. Whilst at university I intend to contribute greatly, since it is my philosophy to engage diligently with all that life has to offer."
"I see engineering principles in everyday life. As how I truly see it, knowing how an object works is truly fascinating. In music, as an experienced timpanist, it is important to understand something as simple as the ratchet clutch system in the pedals to the tuning mechanism in the equalization of tension on the skin of the drum.
I grew up fostering an interest in mechanical objects and the desire to invent and innovate. As a child, I built toy cars out of daily objects such as ice-cream sticks and bottle caps.
Slowly I began to start modifying my inventions to increase the efficiency of the car. For instance, implementing the use of rubber bands to enable car rotation and straws to reduce friction between the axle and the tyre.
It fascinates me that from Physics and Chemistry, I now perceive that the whole world is always in motion, and hence I am particularly interested in the mechanical applications of everyday life, especially objects involving movement.
To further my interest in Engineering I have read several books and taken the opportunity to participate in lectures and talks. A TED talk from Stephen Petranek concerning the possibility of living on Mars and how we could survive, showed me how important it is for Engineers to be open-minded to the possibilities of overcoming the impossible.
Fawn Qiu's project on building a game that is mechanically engineered provoked my interest in how fun, easy and interactive Mechanical Engineering can be.
Her idea was to invent games using daily objects and is demonstrated by introducing the 'Gaming Box' consisting of a simple circuitry and rotation of a sheet of designed paper, imitating the popular mobile game 'flappy bird'.
Henry Petroski's book 'Success through Failure' emphasized how Engineering is a process of predicting and preventing failures; coming to a realization that Engineering is a form of practice to reach the best results possible.
I have also enjoyed reading about the history of Engineering in 'Engineering in the Ancient World' by J.G. Landels which discussed the inventions of great Engineers from 2700BC in Ancient Egypt by the great Imhotep to 300BC with regard to the momentous invention of levers and watermills by the Greeks.
I enjoy problem solving, especially in Mathematics and find it very satisfying to solve complex equations. Physics also interests me greatly. Theories such as the Apex Line Theory and Traction Circle Theory that I first discovered after participating in a mini-go kart race, has made me question further on the application of Mathematics integrated into Physics.
Physics has honed my ability to research, investigate and solve problems presented to me, for example, the need to give appropriate comments and conclusions even if it comes to failing an experiment. I believe that this is one of the key aspects of being an Engineer, the ability to solve problems with not only determination but also with discipline, commitment and efficiency.
Alongside my love for mechanics, I have also been involved in several extra-curricular activities. For five years I was a member of the wind orchestra in secondary school, taking the position of Head Percussionist for three years. My greatest feat was going to Hong Kong Disneyland with my fellow band mates to perform.
I have also played chess competitively in tournaments for many years. Sports such as Taekwondo have also proved to be rewarding as it has taught me to be positively competitive, to always work hard and strive for the best.
British scientists, such as Brunel, have accomplished outstanding and revolutionizing advancements in the field of science possible.
With UK being a spot to some of the world's top centres for research and innovation in the field of Engineering, I believe it will be the ideal location to further my education. Studying here will further my abilities and I will also have a chance to gain from, or even to work, with some of the best of the best in the field."
"It was a recent trip to Pakistan which led me towards Civil Engineering. Whilst travelling, the sheer difference between the infrastructure seen in the UK and Pakistan was shocking.
From the general quality of large-scale construction to the lack of sustainable wastewater treatment methods, I began to understand how civil engineering is at the forefront of literally building a country. Through this experience, I began to appreciate what a significant change Civil Engineers bring to the world. I want to be a part of that.
I became captivated by Civil Engineering, by how the amalgamation of Maths and Physics has solved so many problems, and it has excited me to the extent that I began reading about engineering principles in my spare time.
Gaining this knowledge fed my hunger to know how things worked, ultimately leaving me wanting to study more. One Khan Academy article about buoyant force really sparked my interest.
Something as simple as knowing 'why fluids apply an upwards force on inundated objects' not only provided me with answers but opened my eyes to how exploring fluids could have several applications in the world around us.
I decided to speak to a few Civil Engineers to gain more insight into the career. This led me to applying for a placement with a top engineering firm 'Arup'. One particular project which truly motivated me to pursue a career in the field was the designing of a highway in Wales.
Considering not only the design speed but also the camber required to help vehicles around a bend safely, I realized how without engineering even the simplest things would not be possible.
Working on a real-life problem as a team was exhilarating. During the week, we conducted numerous presentations and Q&A sessions in which the importance of developing leadership and communication skills for life as an Engineer was emphasised.
The significance of these skills is something which I also noticed when attending a 'Women in Engineering Day' at Aston University.
I had always wanted a career which would help people, so I spontaneously picked my A-Level subjects based on pursuing a career in healthcare. Regretting this decision, I have taken a gap year to solidify my choice in Engineering as well as completing my A-Levels.
Taking Biology as an A-Level has made me appreciate the environment immensely, provoking thought on how to maintain sustainability. Chemistry has given a greater insight into properties of materials and their functions, and ICT has given me a profusion of experience with a range of software.
However, no subject has exceeded the satisfaction Mathematics gives me when solving an equation. I decided to tutor pupils in the subject, allowing me to practise something I love, whilst aiding me in financing a trip to volunteer abroad in July to take full advantage of my gap year.
When completing an 8-week ILead course, I was taught how to be an excellent public speaker whilst concurrently working in a team to plan volunteering activities.
When I was voted as team leader and designer during enterprise week, I learned the importance of teamwork as well as the ability to work efficiently under pressure.
Our team successfully managed to design a bike which could charge phones through the rotation of the wheel. I indulge in any opportunity to design something, so when I discovered CAD software in school I was obsessed.
Writing is another passion of mine and along with drawing, it allows me to articulate my ideas effectively.
I have recently combined my love of writing and volunteering by writing a script about female empowerment which was filmed for a large charitable function. It was very rewarding to give back to the community and see the result of something which was initially just an idea on paper.
Ultimately a career in Civil Engineering is my dream and I am excited to further my studies at degree level."
"My ambition is to contribute to break-through innovation to guide us deep into the 21st century and beyond. I want to become a mechanical engineer have always been a very curious individual. I grew up around everything from quads, tractors, to rally cars and motocross bikes.
I loved watching the documentary channel watching ‘How It’s Made’ and often trying to design my own vehicles with Lego and Mechano.
My interest in mechanical engineering first shone through at 11, where I competed in a project for my school in association with Boston Scientific, modelling a basic SUV that would run on pre-existing steam engines. We were selected by Boston staff as winners of the competition.
I have had tours of Boston scientific. I was also selected for a placement at MSD Tipperary which gave me deep insights into chemical, mechanical and process engineering alike.
My time spent at a large machinery retailer and mechanics really gave me experience into applied engineering and the industry. I worked in a John Deere garage from the age of 15 to 17.
I have had numerous jobs from stock work to cleaning and operating heavy machinery, even going out to help assist with service and repairs in an apprenticeship-style role.
I learned things as simple as replacing lawnmower blades to servicing a 310bhp John Deere 7310r. One of my main hobbies is cycling and I spend a lot of time working on my bike, changing parts making it lighter and trying to make it more efficient. My interests in motorsport really boosted my deep attraction to engineering.
Having motocross bikes and quads my whole life has given me practical skills and rational thinking.
When I complete my MEng, I hope to enter the motor industry and become a design engineer for companies such as BMW group, GM or Jaguar Land Rover Automotive.
My life goal in engineering is to create a car which is truly environmentally friendly, practical and that can really take us into the future.
I hope to achieve this goal by securing an internship in my third year of college, before entering the motor industry on completion of my degree.
I value my education highly, achieving grade A honours in Maths, Science, Technical Graphics, Textiles and Materials Technology (TMT), Geography, History and CSPE in my Junior Certificate.
In TMT I learned lathe skills, applied design skills and numerous types of equipment, which I really enjoyed. I also currently study DCG which focuses on problems through drawing and involves Solidworks Design.
These skills are essential in engineering and taught me to be creative and think outside the box.
I am currently working to design a computer mouse for schools and colleges teaching basic 3D graphic design for my LC project. I also enjoy my physics and maths classes as I find them interesting and rewarding. I love applying my knowledge and problem solving.
I am a team leader and a good decision maker. I have used these qualities particularly in captaining my rugby team. I work well in high pressure situations such as in my part time job in a busy McDonalds. This job has also taught me time management, decidedness’ and organisation.
Other achievements include receiving a Gaisce president’s award Medal, and competing in numerous musical competitions such as Cor Fheile and Walton’s Music for Schools, where I had a trumpet solo in the National Concert Hall (Dublin).
I have completed voluntary work which has shaped my personality as a whole volunteering to train underage rugby teams and coaching at summer camps.
This has helped develop my mentoring and teamwork skills further. I have volunteered locally in St. Patrick’s hospital and St. John the Baptist N.S.
My most eye opening voluntary work was my time spent in Scoil Aonghusa, a school for children with multiple difficulties (physical and emotional) but all have moderate to severe learning disability.
Recently I have also been shortlisted for scholarship by Godolphin for my interests in mechanical engineering and voluntary work."
"As my father is an engineer, I was exposed to some aspects of engineering from a young age, especially mechanical and electrical engineering.
Seeing what he does laid the foundation for my love for engineering. Asides from my family's influence on me, I am interested in engineering because it is practical, deals with how things work, involves critical thinking and my favourite subjects being Physics and Mathematics. I would love to build a career in Engineering because I see it as my way to change or at least contribute to developing the world.
Over the years, I have been able to feed my interest in Engineering in a number of ways. One of this is by attending a University Technical College.
Taking A-level physics opened my eyes to a lot of things, as we performed several practicals which were very interesting. In physics, the most interesting topic to me has always been electricity, because it is an essential component of practically every system in the world in the age of technology. Now I observe myself trying to understand different systems around me.
For instance, when I see a device, I think of the mechanism behind it, especially the electrical system. I also try to repair spoilt appliances at home, when I think I have a chance before calling a technician. Out of class, I play around with simulators like circuit wizard. I believe my inquisitive mind about how things work will be very helpful in the field of engineering.
Asides from my academics, I have been involved in various seminars and projects with the aim of developing myself and helping others. Through my school's partnership with many businesses and the University of Warwick, I have had many opportunities to meet and chat with engineers from various companies and draw inspiration from them.
I also attended Women in Engineering seminars where I learned about working and studying in the engineering sector.
Most recently I attended 'The Skills Show 2017' and got the chance to do some hands-on work. I built a traffic signal circuit using a manual and made a permanent magnet motor. I also got to troubleshoot, diagnose and repair the failure of the motor as it didn't work at first.
Constantly trying to improve, I am currently undergoing the Huawei ICT skill competition Western Europe 2017 and Duke of York award which recognizes work experience, communication skills and problem-solving.
In 2016, I participated in Democracy Day at Coventry City Council. Role-playing as a City council member, I participated in allocating funds and building social amenities in a virtual city.
This helped develop my teamwork skills while working alongside my classmates. I served in various capacities while in high school which involved relating with and assisting my schoolmates as well the school staff on various levels and this instilled in me a leadership spirit.
During the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria, as then Health prefect, I made sure measures to prevent infection were upheld, such as ensuring every student washes their hands well as they are coming into school and before their lunch. I have also involved myself in some charity work over the recent years.
I volunteered in Scope Charity store where I helped arrange and restock shelves. I was the secretary of the Grenville's charity club and had the role of writing the meetings minutes, managing funds and assisting in organising events.
These responsibilities taught me to be more caring, patient and organized. I also engage in some sports periodically like Basketball and I recently won a gold medal for Long Jump at the RCCG UK sports day 2017.
Finally, I believe that a degree in electrical and electronics in university is the first step to achieving my dream which is to make the world more efficient, by creating effective systems.
I am aware that studying this course at the university will have its challenges but I believe in my determination and academic ability to complete my degree and be successful in the engineering field."
"We are about to embark on the Fourth Industrial Revolution and I want to be at the forefront of it. Impressive developments in everything from nanotechnology to autonomous vehicles are going to shape the future for all of us, and as an engineer I hope to be able to improve the lives of millions.
I have always had a profound interest in what the future might have in store for us and reading ‘The Industries of the Future’ by Alec Ross highlighted the need for highly skilled engineers, epitomised by the statistic that there will be a shortfall of over 2 million nurses for the elderly by 2025 in Japan alone.
It is our responsibility as engineers to solve a problem like this by designing specialist robots who can do the same job as the nurses. I believe that I have the skills and passion to be able to help in such instances.
I also find electronics particularly interesting, so, when I went for 2 weeks of work experience at Pure, I was delighted to be put into the lab to work with the hardware team. I was tasked with taking apart speakers and modifying the PCBs so that they were ready to be taken to an electronics exhibition in Berlin.
This experience was invaluable for me because, as well as developing teamwork and communication skills, I also learned new skills such as surface mount soldering, crimping and using enamel wire. The practical aspect of the work reaffirmed to me that engineering is right for me.
As part of my schools Engineering Education Scheme (EES) team, I was elected project manager. Our task, sponsored by BP, was to design a transit vibration monitoring tool and managing the project helped me develop my organisation and delegation skills.
Additionally, I took a lead role in designing the electronics for our product. We attached a thermal probe and accelerometer to a Raspberry Pi and I programmed these, using Python, to work simultaneously.
The Pi would constantly compare the outputs from the probe and accelerometer against predetermined values to see if they had been exceeded, indicating shock or extreme temperatures.
Through participation in this scheme, I achieved the CREST Gold Award and Industrial Cadets Gold Award. One thing I thoroughly enjoyed on my work experience and whilst working on our EES project was problem solving. I learnt that with technically complex projects you will encounter issues every step of the way, and finding a solution is incredibly rewarding.
Another passion of mine is sailing – I love how tactical and technical it can be. The design of dinghies is fascinating, with each boat meticulously crafted to be aerodynamic and hydrodynamic for optimum performance.
The primary material of choice in many sailing dinghies is fibreglass, a material I researched in some depth as part of a physics project. When sailing, I relish the challenge of, for example, maintaining a flat boat to reduce the wetted surface area of the hull, decreasing drag and consequently increasing velocity.
My sailing partner and I compete in the National Schools Sailing Association National Regatta each year and our best finish was 4th in our fleet in 2017.
I have also been a member of the Scouting Association from a very young age and I am currently an Explorer; I particularly enjoy activities like pioneering and raft building.
Additionally, I volunteered at my local charity bookshop for 3 years and was awarded the Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service last year. Within school I was appointed a Senior Prefect and I also run the Maths in Motion club, a competition in which a friend and I were crowned Secondary School World Champions in 2015.
At my school’s Prize Giving, I was given the Physics award and the ‘Stephen Shipperley Award for Enterprise and Innovation’ in Year 12 in addition to the Design Technology award in Year 10
I believe that my abilities mean that I am perfectly suited to studying engineering at university and I am excited to see where a challenging degree will take me."
"Doorbells were infuriating when I was young; towers I couldn't hope to reach. I became angry each time an adult had to press those alluring buttons for me. I was ten then and in a child's eyes, world war three had started with my enemies, the doorbells, advancing into my territory.
Under my supervisor's gaze, I spent days working tirelessly in my school's technical lab till I found a solution. A doorbell triggered by my weight, one that sang when I stepped on it. It was encased in a rug-covered box that represented a makeshift porch; a rough product but I had won the war.
Though mediocre in comparison to the plethora of technological discoveries people have made, this childhood victory shaped my mind irrevocably. I realised that in my hands lay the key to make this world a place I would want generations after me to be happy to inhabit.
The various problems that hadn't been solved seemed to become blaring beacons seeking me out and I aim to answer every call. I am no doctor-in-training but machinations have enough sway to save lives if not as much as medications do.
It occurred to me that I didn't need an understanding of the human anatomy to save a man's life. I just needed the ability to identify a problem and solve it using practical knowledge that can be gained through engineering.
However, there are various forms of engineering. I don't want to make sturdy duplexes or speedy cars, at least not all my life. Having an innate talent in Technical Drawing, everyone proposed Civil or Architectural engineering. I tried both out.
During my time as an intern at my father's building companies, I explored other branches of engineering. The buildings never captivated me as well as the machines used to erect them. The bolts and nuts holding our universe together were what kept me working there not the houses or offices.
I needed an in-depth form of engineering that took apart the machinations that run our world; an understanding of how things around me worked. To start on the broad base this personal quest requires, a firm foundation in a wide range of principles revolving around electricity and mechanics is necessary.
This is why I chose Mechatronic Engineering. It is a well-crafted course that satisfies my passion better than any other.
My school clubs contributed to and trained me for my decision. Through them, I discovered my love for STEM subjects. I was an influential member of my school's JETS club and Maths club which both won numerous awards.
I took on leadership roles where I trained junior and senior members to succeed and clinch the top places in various exams, supervised tests and in the maths club, even invented formulas that could shorten the time taken to answer certain questions.
Through these activities, I not only learnt how to take on managerial positions, but also learnt how to handle many topics I couldn't with our syllabi. The failures we encountered gave me the zeal to persevere through academic disappointments.
Working in teams developed my team spirit, an essential skill for group projects in colleges. The competitions I participated in granted me valuable insight into topics beyond my grade which helped me build a flexible mentality to think ahead.
In addition, I learnt to withstand a stressful load of work with classes for eleven hours five days a week due to the extra training sessions I signed up for. As a result, I have the resilience I have been told many engineering aspirants need to persevere through my chosen course.
Following my graduation three years prior to this writeup which I spent working to raise my tuition fees, I decided to do a foundation program since my country's qualifications are unacceptable. I believe your program is the best for me as I'm very eager to start learning core engineering principles instead of subjects I treated in high school.
The modules listed on your website intrigued me as did the positive student feedback I received. I'm quite certain your school will give me the exposure and sufficient preparation I need for my preferred degree."
"I became interested in studying Mechanical Engineering through conversations with my father about physics when I was in middle school.
Engineering intrigued me the most as I found it enthralling that the application of theoretical concepts derived from sciences can be used to solve seemingly impossible issues that would otherwise not be physically possible for humans to accomplish alone.
My appreciation for the sciences, specifically physics was further developed through reading Neil DeGrasse Tyson's ""Astrophysics for people in a hurry"". My fascination peaked in the 10th grade, when I put the knowledge gained from classical mechanics into practice. Simple experiments were enough to convince me a career in a physics field is what I wish to pursue.
After having completed courses in Classical Mechanics, Gravitational Physics, and Automotive Engineering offered by different online academic reinforcement websites such as brilliant.org and recalling actions I took as a young child out of curiosity.
These included breaking open Remote-Controlled cars to understand how they worked and having my father explain to me how radio waves emitted from the controller are received by the car then a corresponding charge is sent to the correct motor to propel the toy in the specified direction.
After this, I knew my true aspiration was to study mechanical engineering, driving me to read ""To engineer is human: the role of failure in successful design"" by Henry Petroski, and Donald Norman's ""The design of everyday things"", giving me great insight and helping me realize that successful designs can still fail due to factors not previously considered, and that designing something is a much more intricate process than I previously thought.
I try to be as multiskilled as possible, either by learning programming languages including c and matlab or playing the piano, to name a few skills I have acquired through practice and research, all helping me enhance my creativity and discipline. In the summer of 2018 I worked at a car repair shop.
Learning the process of identifying and resolving a problem. Through helping repair cars I learned traits and acquired skills, such as logic, patience, teamwork and critical thinking not just by working there but naturally through my life as a person with a mild form of myopathy.
Having spent my early life in and out of hospitals and working with a physical therapist for over 11 years, I have also come to appreciate taking on new challenges to improve myself.
Having skipped 8th grade entirely due to this, having undergone 3 intense surgeries for scoliosis, resulting in self study to pass exams has taught me how to clear my mind and take on any obstacle that comes my way. Independent study to pass the year helped me view subjects I used to see as purely academic and turn them into interests of mine, which was when I came to understand how much I love learning about science.
Researching and studying topics on my own has given me the ability to be self-motivated, an important trait to cultivate for the IB program. I have tried out experiments in my Physics HL course.
For my extended essay I tested how different variables of a copper parallel plate capacitor affect the capacitance whilst for my Internal Assessment I set out to undertake a unique experiment; to study diffraction and how the angle of the diffraction grating affects the distance between the maximums from the central maxima.
Performing these has improved my analytical and research skills as well as applying theoretical concepts in practical means.
My physical setbacks used to be a challenge in my life, a reason why I want to study in the UK. I want to gain independence and take advantage of the work opportunities there.
The opportunity to study at a deeper level what I have a passion for will help me achieve a lot in the future."
"SpaceX’s plan to send one million people to Mars over 50 years is a thrilling prospect. It is an unprecedented project that may seem wild, yet shows how much might be achieved when engineers push the boundaries of science and technology.
Being at the forefront of advanced technologies and having an input in creating a sustainable future is my motivation for wanting to study engineering.
Following a stimulating week at the University of Birmingham’s Physics Experience Week in Year 10, I knew I wanted to study a Physics based subject. I gained invaluable insight into university life and university-level physics concepts, such as the Higgs Boson and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I also learnt the basics of calculus.
This was the motivation that led me to take GCSE Additional Mathematics near the end of Year 11.
My interest has further been peaked by participation in the EDT Engineering Education Scheme. In this problem-solving exercise, we worked with graduates from Rolls-Royce Control Systems to develop the design of a pressure drop control valve intended for use in the Trent XWB engine.
The entire project was underpinned with robust team work and effective communication. We were awarded Gold Crest Awards upon completion.
I have enjoyed mentoring junior peers as Maths Ambassador; while with fellow sixth formers, I supported the learning of juniors within Physics and Chemistry clubs.
Beyond classroom learning, I volunteered with Acorns Children’s Hospice and also assisted EngineeringUK by volunteering for activities and engaging with the public during the Big Bang Science Fair 2017. I have achieved the Lions ‘Young Leaders in Service’ award for my contribution to service.
As co-leader of the weekly school Engineering Society, I help invite guest speakers from the University of Birmingham and from industry. For instance, a representative from Jaguar Land Rover delivered a talk on the electric car technology and the career opportunities available.
My Headstart course in aerospace engineering was at Coventry University. In a team, we designed, built and tested a semi-monocoque model glider wing. Incorporating the fundamentals of wing design, I studied the moment of inertia and bending moment in order to predict the maximum load the wing could support on its tip.
Consequently, ‘The Simple Science of Flight’ by Henk Tennekes formed part of my reading on design principles.
On a week’s placement with Siemens AGT in Warwick, I shadowed staff in the working environment. It was invaluable preparation for a career within the industry, and the responsibilities that arise from it. I learned how gas turbine engines from aviation are modified to produce aero-derivative engines for a variety of uses.
Similarly, ‘Impossible Engineering’ documentaries illustrate how research and innovation in one area can inspire momentous improvements in another. For instance, engineers developed US Navy combat ships using duralumin instead of the traditional steel, thereby making them as light and fast as possible.
This decision was inspired by the DC3 Flagship Detroit: the world’s first commercial metal airliner. For me the dynamic scope of engineering is incredibly fascinating.
In preparation for future studies, I am familiarising myself with ‘Engineering Mathematics’ by K.A. Stroud. Mostly it is accessible, although I expect to work harder to absorb the more complex topics like differential equations. My other interests include guitar practice towards grade 6, teaching myself piano, recreational swimming, tennis and computer programming.
The professional focus of an accredited Engineering (MEng) degree will suitably equip me to pursue a career specialising in the aerospace sector. In the future, I envisage continuing my studies to research level and lecturing, as I feel the pleasures of this ever-expanding industry should be shared to inspire future generations."
"Samsung S10e or iPhone XR? Last year I had such a difficult choice to make; I would spend countless hours watching comparison videos on YouTube to help me decide which should be my next purchase. Despite me purchasing neither of them, this enquiry started my interest in chip architectures in consumer products.
I was interested in the benchmarks they use to categorise the performance of the chipsets in these devices; this led me to research about transistors and how their size affects the performance of a computer, where I learnt about semiconducting materials and how their properties make them suitable in making transistors. I am excited to study Electrical Engineering to learn about instruction set architectures and increase my understanding of circuit design as I'd like to contribute to the research and the development of chipsets.
During my physics lessons, I discovered the concept of semiconductors and their uses in the industry. I was interested in the fact that chip manufacturers continually strive to reduce the size of the transistors, as this would lead to substantial performance and efficiency gains, that would make the previous chip's performance obsolete.
I enrolled in the ""Principle of Semiconductor Devices"" course, provided by Hong Kong University, to further my understanding of the properties of semiconducting materials and why they are used in making transistors. I learnt that semiconducting materials have a bandgap, the gap between the valence and the conductive bands of a material; the wider this is, the more efficient the power conversion.
A greater bandgap could make a semiconductor block of the same voltage while being thinner than one with the shorter bandgap, cutting resistance by reducing the distance the current must flow. This improvement translates in a performance boost or efficiency, depending on the use case: while in a smartphone the focus would be on efficiency and battery life, a desktop computer would prioritise performance.
While stuck in the YouTube rabbit hole, I watched many videos comparing the GPUs in phones. It motivated me to read articles about GPUs and get a better understanding on how they help improve the graphical performance of a system, such as ""Rise and rise of GPUs"" from Ingenia.org.uk, where I learnt about pipelines and bubbles.
To perform work, a CPU has to overlap the instructions it works on in ""pipelines"" and bubbles occur when operations from these have to stall, resulting in a delay as data must be fetched from memory to complete it. GPUs attempt to reduce bubbles by making data available earlier through faster local memory. Their design helps achieve their purpose: they are made from arrays of computational engines, each with a specified task, including fetching data from memory.
During my time on a computer science course provided by Harvard (the CS50), I learnt the coding language ""Python"" and how to use frameworks like Django and Flask to build websites, and simple applications such as Tic Tac Toe.
The programme helped me to acquire problem-solving skills as I would often troubleshoot my code and debug it. I enjoy pushing myself by taking part in academic competitions, over the years I participated in: the Cambridge Chemistry Challenge; the British Physics Olympiad; and the UKMT Junior Maths Challenge. In each, I achieved a copper certificate, Bronze 1 and a gold certificate respectively.
In my spare time, I do freelance photography and manage an Instagram page- where I share my work- and also commission art as well as cartoon animation videos. I expose some of my artwork in shows; recently, I entered an art competition organised by the Luxembourg Art Museum.
I take pleasure creating in my free time and believe that an engineer must have mathematical skills and be creative to tackle problems. I think that by taking courses in programming and participating in science competitions, I have a strong foundation that I hope to build upon during my time at university."
"I remember my first experience of engineering was when I was quite young. In year 2, a couple of students and I were taken to complete a project where we had to build a small cart out of household items and we competed against schools in our local area to see how far our cars could travel down a ramp. However, we didn’t do very well. Obviously, the reasoning was far above my understanding at the time but experiences like that established an inquisitiveness for the way the world works especially regarding engineering.
My interest in engineering and computer science has determined my choices at A Level as Maths, Further Maths, Physics. I also study Music as it’s one of my passions and am about to complete my Grade 8 Piano. I love problem solving; it is what engineering is all about. To develop my problem solving skills, I started attending further physics sessions in Year 12. Using Isaac Physics, we worked through higher level questions including mechanics. Motivated by these sessions, I asked my teachers to recommend some resources that provided a greater challenge and my physics teacher brought out a book called “Professor Povey's Perplexing Problems''. This has provided a great insight into the world of physics in general. Since joining The Royal Latin, I have also been selected to take part in UKMT Maths Challenges and British Physics Olympiads and receive bronze and silver awards regularly. I particularly enjoy these because they encourage thinking outside the box and develop problem-solving; they are part of the reason why I wanted to study A level Further Maths.
During Sixth Form, I put myself forward to join [Insert Sixth Form]’s student leadership team. Following a very rigorous and thorough interview process, I was selected to be deputy head boy. This role has enabled me to work with younger students, parents and staff. During the year I have developed my time management and organisational skills enabling me to balance my academic studies with this added responsibility. Taking parents and prospective students on tours of the school has developed my communication skills further and I’m very proud to be representing my school in this way.
I have taken the opportunity to complete my DofE Gold award whilst at school. I am a keen sportsman and enjoy sports such as swimming and cycling. For the service part of the award, I am a volunteer coach at my swimming club. Working with other coaches and talking to swimmers has definitely improved my communication, confidence and teamwork skills. Another one of my hobbies is computing. During Summer 2021, I applied for the CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course that is led by Harvard University on edX. While also studying C, Python and computing fundamentals, this course offered me an insight into how lectures and homework assignments are like at a university and gave me a chance to establish independent learning skills.
I took the initiative to arrange work experience with a company called EM Motorsport for a week. In this role, I helped to build the control panels for the Bahrain Grand Prix that year. This involved soldering wires to boards, building the control panel itself and briefly looking at the code. I particularly enjoyed the week as I’m interested in Formula 1 and the inner workings of cars. I’d also love to be a part of a Formula Student team and build and design cars . I enjoy watching videos on the topic and I am subscribed to channels such as Engineering Explained. Road cycling has played a big part in my interest in engineering and in particular the mechanical workings and aerodynamic saving. I enjoy researching newer technologies that are being developed such as the effort to decrease rolling resistance in tires, testing the sweet spots between aerodynamic design and low weight for hills. Therefore a degree in engineering or computer science will provide a good foundation for this and I relish the opportunity of studying for it at university."
"Curiosity has always been my nature since I was young and I was never afraid to know more as I really like challenges.
This is why I have a keen interest in science ever since I started formal education, it explains the hows and whys in almost anything and everything.
As I grow older, I realise that Physics actually fits me better than other sciences like Biology and Chemistry. It intrigues me a lot and leads me to the decision of pursuing my studies in engineering.
Among so many branches of engineering, why would I choose electrical and electronics engineering. Today we are living in an era of technology, electricity plays an important role in our daily life and we can hardly get through a day without electricity.
Electricity is a form of energy. We cannot feel its presence with our physical senses, but we still strongly rely on it.
Simple things around us like the light, television and even our mobile phones, none of them can be operated without electricity. In addition to that, Tesla Motors, a U.S company even manufactures electric cars which are fully electric powered.
As we can see, electricity has had, and will continue to impact our daily life. I am truly amazed by how this invisible but powerful form of energy affect us so much and this is one of the main reasons I wish to further my studies in electrical engineering.
Growing up, the exposure to mass media such as documentaries and Internet has slowly induced my passion towards electrical engineering. I have always enjoyed watching “Mythbusters” and “Curiosity” on Discovery Channel. These documentaries gave me the answers to a lot of questions on my mind.
During my Diploma in electrical engineering studies in INTI College, I have gained more knowledge in electrical engineering through lectures and experiments.
I never knew that we were able to design a door bell by just implementing RC circuit theory and passive components. Besides that, mathematical principles can also be used in circuit analysis.
System behaviours of a circuit can be determined and analysed by mathematical approach or using MATLAB software, which is something new to me.
On top of that, I have seen my seniors building an interactive robot, Mega 1 from scratch. The robot went all the way to Madrid, Spain for a robotics contest and they even won the grand prize! I feel motivated and I am even certain with my decision of becoming an electrical engineer after looking at their works.
I believe that by exploring deeper in this field and utilising what I have learnt, one day in the future I could be like them or even better and introduce more creations to this world. Besides that, I will begin my internship in Philips Lumileds Lighting Company in January 2015.
I believe this experience will grant me insight into the real industrial world and the organization structure of a multinational company, thus prepare myself for the future.
Apart from striving for academic excellence, I am also actively involved in extracurricular activities. I used to be the secretary of my high school’s Young Enterprise Club.
I have learnt that teamwork, determination and good communication are the keys to success. I was very glad and proud to be part of our team, we won the Best Managed Company award.
Besides that, I was also a Training Director in our school’s JCI Junior Club. I developed a sense of responsibility to give back to the society.
During college, I joined the electronic club and Student Ambassador to broaden my knowledge and improve my leadership and communication skills.
I enjoy watching educational videos or documentaries online during my free time as these keep me updated on the current trend and technology.
Furthermore, I play all kind of sports like basketball, soccer and Frisbee to keep myself physically and mentally healthy.
I believe that UK has high quality education and I hope with my electrical engineering qualification, I will be able to make this world a much better place. Will building an Iron Man suit be still a dream? Or a reality?
Well, I believe engineering holds the answer."
"When I was a child, most of the sentences I spoke out finished with a question mark, asking how everyday things work.
Receiving answers to these questions and learning more about Mathematics and Physics has enlarged my desire to make human life easier and become an Engineer.
At school, I fell in love with Geometry, which remains my favourite subject. I enjoy Mathematics and Physics because they provide answers to many of my questions about the world we live in and provide knowledge that is used to solve real problems.
At the age of 11 I received an award by the Hellenic Mathematical Society, which was repeated the following year.
Then, at the age of 13, I made it to the last step before choosing the national team for the Mathematics Olympiad. Last year, I was awarded by the Mathematical Kangaroo competition.
I have the honour of being the flag-bearer in the school parades, which is always assigned to the school’s best student.
For many years, I have made science demonstration equipment for the school lab. For instance, the school owns a small wind turbine, my very first functioning contraption, which uses wind energy to power an LED.
Some other things I have built include a tensegrity model from straws and elastic bands and a mirror labyrinth that directs a laser beam.
One year ago, an English teacher recommended taking part in MOOCs. Suddenly, I entered a new world of learning, where everything was easily accessible.
Up to now, I have successfully finished two courses: Introduction to Philosophy by the University of Edinburgh and An Introduction to Engineering Mechanics by the Georgia Institute of Technology, with a grade of 98.6% and 100% respectively.
Searching for more learning opportunities, I am currently learning Spanish on the online application Duolingo. I help spreading knowledge, by writing subtitles for Udacity and Khan Academy videos, so that more people can join the community of online learning. I am also the administrator of our school’s geek-o-blog, a blog about technology and science.
This summer I worked for two weeks in an engineering company in Athens, in order to learn how a real engineer works. There, I obtained valuable knowledge on materials and on how engineers choose the best materials and exploit their characteristics when a stable structure is built.
However, the activity that has influenced me the most in becoming a Mechanical Engineer was my participation in the 2013 Formula 1 in schools championship. I was the leader of a team of nine teenagers that represented my school.
After studying aerodynamics, we designed a miniature car in CAD/CAM environment and constructed it with a CNC machine and a 3D-printer. Meanwhile, we advertised our team and managed to finish sixth in sixty teams, receiving the award for best marketing and sponsors.
Although I barely knew most of the other team members at the beginning, we formed close bonds that continue to exist even after the competition. Undoubtedly, we increased our knowledge in Physics and computer aided design, as well as gaining valuable experience about real life.
As a team leader, I improved my leadership and time organisation skills and I learned how to work with other people, with whom I share a common goal.
In my spare time, I do karate, which I have been practicing since I was 10 and took the black belt four years later. I also play tennis and basketball with my friends, which helps me relax and have fun.
Some other hobbies are playing the piano, cooking, reading crime novels and going to the cinema. However, my favourite activity is travelling, since I love learning about other cultures and admiring the diversity of human civilisation.
All my life, I have wondered how things work. Now I want to know how things work, how to make things work and how to design things that will work. And I hope that my creations will make future children ask the same questions I did as a child."
"As I triggered the release mechanism and watched two pounds of rock hurtle skywards I thought to myself, ""trebuchets are awesome!"".
Years passed before I realised that this was my first engineering project. I want to pursue a general course of study in order to better understand all aspects of engineering and explore the boundaries between those aspects. Particularly, I wish to look at the relationship between mechanics and electronics.
It fascinates me that electronics can be seen as a nervous system providing feedback and control when combined with a mechanical device.
I first encountered this in my GCSE D and T project: a piano lamp. I designed a product capable of extensive physical flexibility and then integrated a bright white LED strip and current controller.
I enjoyed the challenge of creating a pathway for the electronics and even visited a monumental mason who helped me to shape the slate base.
My lamp was so successful that my piano teacher commissioned me to make him one.
Over the last year I have been a member of an EESW team. We worked with Statkraft, Europe's largest renewable energy generator, to develop a device that can detect oil on the surface of water.
The project is another example of mechanics and electronics coming together and I had a strong influence on the mechanical design as well as being responsible for the electronics.
I feel I have a good idea of what is a practical solution and I was able to quickly identify promising design concepts. We settled for a floating device and used fluorescence spectroscopy as our method of detection. After destroying several Op Amps I had a working circuit and we had a working device.
We were very successful in the North Wales EESW competition, delivering an excellent presentation and receiving the prize for 'Most Innovative Project' alongside a joint first score of 53/55.
Following our success in North Wales we were invited to the regional final of the Big Bang competition in Swansea where we again performed very well, receiving awards for 'Experimentation and Refinement' and 'Crest's Best in Show' and an invitation to the national final in March, where we will compete against the best 100 teams in Britain.
We are developing a second prototype in preparation. Alongside these competitions I also completed my 'Crest Gold Award' in engineering. The award helped me to sum up the project and reflect on my personal development throughout.
This project is an example of one of the most important areas of engineering: systems and control. The idea that a device can measure a variable and exercise control to effect that variable is fundamental to much of today's world.
In school I attend a debating society and we hold formal debates on topical scientific arguments. Recently I led the debate arguing for the motion: 'We Can All Keep Warm Using Renewable Energy'. David JC MacKay's book, 'Sustainable Energy - Without the Hot Air', helped me prepare and was an interesting, refreshing look at the argument, using simple facts and demonstrating the mathematics behind them.
Outside of school I enjoy attending 'Technoclub"" where I am currently working on a robot that responds to the beat of a song.
I am a keen climber and have been volunteering as a coach for several years, teaching young climbers and helping them improve. I have enjoyed this as it has forced me to fully understand the mechanics of climbing in order to explain something as physical as a single climbing move.
I am currently organising a week's work experience with Statkraft to be completed at the local hydroelectric power station. I am hopeful that this will show me in more detail some of the roles that engineers can play. I intend to participate in a year's industrial experience either before or during my university course.
This will provide further experience of practical engineering, expand my engineering knowledge and develop my skills in a challenging new environment."
"Having spent most of my early childhood abroad and the rest in an international school, English has become my primary language. Despite being fluent in my native language, Vietnamese, I prefer using English most of the time, especially when it comes to studying.
Many revolutionising advancements in engineering have been made possible by English scientists, such as Isaac Newton. With the United Kingdom being one of the world's top centres of research and innovation for the field of Engineering, I believe it will be the ideal location for my higher education.
Not only will studying there further my abilities, but I will also have the opportunity to learn from, or even work with, some of the most brilliant minds in the field.
Above most things, I regard leadership and teamwork as a necessity for any career path, and Engineering is no exception. This is why I currently hold the position of Co-Chair in my school's Student Council. Sport has also taught me a great deal about cooperation, teamwork, and adaptation.
Although I have chosen to devote all my time working towards three A* for the final A-Level examination, I still regularly visit the basketball court. As I have been told, universities in the United Kingdom provide an overwhelming range of clubs, committees and activities I could commit myself to.
Since my philosophy is that you must find the balance between academic and recreational activities before you can succeed, this plays an essential part in my decision to go to the United Kingdom.
In terms of academic interest, Physics is extremely interesting to me. With every lesson that goes by, I learn something new, and the more I learn the more I realise how little I know. Things which I once thought were simple are now very complicated.
However, this simply makes the subject more fascinating and intriguing. I love understanding how things work, and Physics does specifically that.
Physics is the never ending endeavour to question and explain the anomalies of the natural world, and it is the one subject I would gladly spend the rest of my life studying.
As strong as my passion for Physics is, I also have an undeniable passion for Mathematics. I have always been conflicted in what career path I should take, that was at least until I discovered Mechanics.
Mechanical Engineering provided the perfect solution for me, and I knew that from the first moment I started learning it. Not only will I be able to integrate Mathematics into Physics, I will also be given the choice of innovation.
The thing which made me choose Mechanical Engineering as my path of study is its flexibility. There are infinite possibilities of what I could become upon mastering Mechanics.
Many people say Mechanical Engineering is difficult to learn, let alone master. If anything, this only adds further temptation to the task. After all, what is advancement, if not the challenging of oneself?
Comprehension of Mechanical concepts has so far not been an issue, and I doubt it ever will be. As a matter of fact, it is the only subject in my life in which I have ever felt absolute confidence.
Mechanical Engineering is indisputably one of the most challenging disciplines in modern academia.
Despite that, I was raised to believe that nothing is impossible, especially when you have a passion for it. I know this is the ideal discipline for me, and I am confident. I will be great at it.
This is what I am going to do, and no one will convince me otherwise."
"The defining wonder of today’s age is electricity. In just two centuries, we have come from Faraday’s crude but prophetic experiments to devices just a square inch that can calculate in seconds what the most gifted of human minds might take days.
But much more stunning than computer chips are the other virtues of electricity.
Millions of bulbs lighting up a city at night, real time radio communications across continents, the means to reproduce and re-live sounds and sights, electricity has transformed all of humanity in a few short and increasingly hectic generations.
There might well be a point in time when we need to have more electrical engineers than we need to have farmers.
I have studied science subjects in both my O and A Levels, but only near the end of my A Level Physics course was I able to reconcile all the knowledge about currents and resistances and electrostatic inductions to real life applications of electricity.
The structure of operational amplifiers, the means to convert electricity into light or radio waves, and transmit it (and vice versa) all fascinated me immensely because finally I could see the how the small picture linked to the big picture.
I have also studied Biology throughout high school concurrent to Mathematics and Physics, but now at the end of my A Levels I am sure that I want to pursue electrical engineering as a career. This is primarily because of the fascination I have discovered for applications of Physics and Mathematics.
Aside from my studies, my foremost interest is sports, and I not only ardently follow many, but actively participate in a few. I have a passion for cricket, and have been part of the school team at provincial level several times.
I also like to play badminton, squash, table tennis and have recently started football too. Essentially any sport which combines hand-eye coordination and rapid reflexes and movement holds appeal for me. I also swim for recreation.
I have received a bronze medal in the international Kangaroo mathematics contest, and was part of the team that was awarded the second prize in the school science fair last year. I spent my last two summers doing voluntary community service.
I spent a month at Pakistan Society for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled (PSRD) and I also volunteered at the CARE Foundation, which works to educate or rehabilitate the victims of the October 2005 earthquake in Pakistan.
What I most value in both these experiences is that I got a perspective on how individual action accumulates and transforms into eventual social progress and advancement.
The environment in Pakistan is only just beginning to be conducive to the field of electrical engineering, because the country has only recently begun to transit from an agrarian economy to an industrial one.
Not only do I plan to contribute in capacity as an engineer, but I also want to play my part in developing the local infrastructure for the field.
I plan to pursue my studies in electrical engineering to the doctorate level, to play my part in developing the local academia.
Ultimately, my decision to study electrical engineering comes about because it combines my foremost interest with my desire to fulfill my social obligation."
"These days, we are surrounded by engineering marvels. From radios to space shuttles, everything involves a vital feat of engineering.
That is what I find most attractive about this field as its application is everywhere. Engineering is the only field which relates to my interests as it involves a lot of maths and physics and some design.
Being part of this field will not only allow me to explore the practical world of my favourite subjects but also give me the opportunity to be part of a field that affects our lives in countless ways.
Since the age of 5, I have always been inquisitive about how things worked; my toys have constantly been the victim of this curiosity. I once placed the motor of a remote control car in a normal push car making it radio controlled, this made me really excited and since then my enthusiasm and motivation towards engineering has only increased.
During my weeks work experience at HLM Architects, I realised the involvement of engineering even in the design stage of construction and how it influences the architects’ choices.
This also taught me that as a successful designer; you not only need to be imaginative but also technical in terms of your creations.
This first occurred to me when I created a rocking chair as my G.C.S.E Design Technology project, one wrong angle calculation made the whole chair unstable.
Studying engineering at university would be an ideal way to combine my passion for designing with my eagerness of physical and mathematical principles to be a successful and imaginative mechanical engineer.
I thoroughly enjoy Physics as it uses mathematical theories to prove physical experiments and vice versa. However the element that intrigues me most is Thermal equilibrium and how this simple concept works so well in our everyday life. During my AS level, I got exposure to various new branches of Mathematics including Algebra, Trigonometry, Mechanics and Calculus.
Out of all these branches, Algebra really fascinates me as it makes complex problems so simple and straightforward. The addition of Computing to my science subjects has enhanced my computational skills and broadened my choices in the field of engineering.
I am currently blending Computing with Maths by creating a program that teaches students a certain aspect of Mathematics. I also believe that studying Design Technology to an AS level has given me a little insight to the design involved in engineering and the stages in product manufacture.
I initially chose Maths, Physics, Design Technology (Graphics) and Computing as I thought these subjects will give me a wider range of options in the field of engineering. This year I have dropped Design Technology and chose Further Maths to be able to cope with the maths involved in Engineering.
I have always been enthusiastic about cross-curriculum activities. As a captain of my school’s cricket team, I managed to lead the team to the semi-finals.
This experience taught me a lot about team work and responsibility. Talent aside, these qualities are essential to produce positive results. I organize my time to accommodate a range of hobbies especially painting. A lot of my art work is still kept in my school as an example for the future students.
In 2007 I took part in Peugeot design Contest to design a city car for the future. I really enjoyed the time I spent in designing the concept but the lack of CAD skills made me no match against professional worldwide designers. To overcome this variance, I took a short course in Auto CAD which taught me the basics of CAD.
I really enjoy watching ""How Stuff Works, Mythbusters and Richard Hammond's Engineering Connections"". These programmes are very engaging and present science in a very exciting manner.
I believe I am ready to embrace university life and the challenges I face ahead. This degree would not only act as a solid base in my future career but also allow me to play a key role in developing new machines and technology."
"Engineers play an integral part in everyday life. They are at the forefront of modern technology and also are at the pinnacle of innovation.
Engineering has taken major leaps in many sectors but most noticeably the aeronautics and mechanical sector. Robots are able to defuse bombs in war torn countries and robots are being designed that are able to perform lifesaving operations. All this wouldn’t have been possible without mechanical engineers.
Without mechanical engineering modern day cars wouldn’t have been possible to manufacture due to the high mechanisation of the car industry. I am fascinated by how technology always has a link to mechanical engineering as it is a constantly changing environment.
I am fascinated even more by mechatronics and would like to research autonomous vehicles and that is why I wish to pursue a course in mechanical engineering.
I am currently an A-level Maths, A-level Physics, A level Chemistry and AS Level Arabic. With my science and maths background I think I am well prepared for the course’s high Maths and Physics content. Some aspects which will covered in the course such as laws of motion I have already studied in Physics.
During my time working as a door to door fundraiser for UNICEF I was able to interact with all kinds of people and to be able to adjust to different attitudes and mannerisms. There was an incident where a resident opened her door and she was not happy to see me there. By smiling and being polite to her she felt reassured calmed down and ended up donating.
This is important because listening is an important skill one needs to have if I am to be successful at university. This is important and is an essential team working skill for university where group projects are common.
I have also done a placement at my local primary school where I was responsible for managing 23 children. My main responsibilities were counselling and managing the children during lunch time.
This has made me mature better as I was in a position of responsibility and also because the children were looking up to me as a role model therefore making me more conscious of my actions.
I currently volunteer at my local community centre FFOP where I am helping train the local community’s over 60 residents. It is not always explaining ICT concepts to them and therefore I have to be creative and come up with analogies for them.
An example of this would be trying to explain to them the implications of not having antivirus on a computer, so I would say that it would be like leaving the front door of your house open.
I have also learnt to be patient and that not everyone has the same understanding level. It also has developed me and matured me as an adult because some of the elder residents will sometimes confide in me and this gives me a sense of responsibility.
During my spare time I enjoy playing football at my local club where I am the team captain. My position enables me to give orders and to be tactically decisive. This has definitely made me more responsible because I know my actions have a direct consequence on the mind set and morale of my team.
It also helps build team working skills because I always discuss with my team the approach we are going to take before a game. I also partake in orienteering which has actually helped me to learn map reading skills and also basic navigation.
I also like to learn new languages and have taught myself Arabic and I am currently starting a course in beginners German. I can currently speak English, Somali and Arabic. I consider myself to be enthusiastic, devoted and diligent individual who takes pride in all his work which will help me in all my future work.
I set myself really high goals and take it upon myself to reach them. My life experiences have taught me to be patient and to remain enthusiastic regardless of the situation. The education system in the United Kingdom is of the highest calibre and will definitely open many doors me."
"With 7 billion people in the world, it's hard for one person to make a significant contribution. Engineering allows you to map your ingenuity onto a creation and to shape the future through innovation. It gives you the opportunity to make a difference in the world and to leave your mark.
The chance to mould that original spark into reality was the deciding factor in making my choice. Living in an interdependent society, the contributions you make individually, effect the life of someone else, making the most of yourself and contributing the best way you can is the purpose of each person.
Focusing on my strengths, maths and physics, I believe I will be achieving that purpose as an engineer, as it requires the ability to project real world problems onto a mathematical model, to solve the problem.
I am currently studying core maths, further maths, physics and design. These give me a fundamental understanding for the course.
Having enjoyed maths from an early age, I have chosen to study the full further maths A-level, in addition with core maths, in my final year in order to expand my knowledge of the subject, and to challenge myself with new concepts.
This has required me to do a lot of work in my free time, honing my ability to work independently. The study of mathematics has provided me with a key skill of problem solving, and it made me a faster learner.
Studying physics, I have learned to adapt my mathematical skills to the real life scenarios, and apply them using logical reasoning to arrive at a solution.
Through design, I learnt the hands-on approach side of resolving problems. This approach taught me to use a range of tools, techniques and equipment to make the final product. It has also taught me a necessary approach to problems, ranging from researching the issue, to implementing the solution with a physical invention.
The coursework area of the subject has given me ability to stick to deadlines and has helped developed my design and organisation skills.
I have completed an AS-level geography, which has made me more aware of the global issues such as global warming, and showed to me the importance of addressing the problem. Studying your course will give me the opportunity to address these issues.
I am also studying Russian A-level in my own time and I am already proficient in Ukrainian, I have a good understanding of Polish, and I am literate in Bulgarian. Being multilingual is a great skill in a world that is becoming more connected due to increased globalisation and migration.
I will be taking a gap year to gain work experience, possibly abroad, to prepare me for my studies, as well as to gain maturity and self-reliance.
In my spare time I participate in various charity events such as Christian kitchen and money rising for Japan. I was also a mentor for a younger student in my college and I was involved in toe-by-toe program that aims to help younger students to read, this required me to attend my college early in the morning three times per week for three months.
This involvement has given me a sense of working in a professional environment, due to the confidentiality that must be maintained at all times.
The list of activities I participate in is extensive, including visits to royal society convention and engineering taster courses, which reinforced my interest in mechanical engineering. I also achieved a first aid, and stewarding level 2 certificates. In my free time I enjoy muay-thai, cycling, swimming, and going to the gym, which helps me relax from my studies and maintain my physical fitness.
I believe I have the desire and the fundamental knowledge that will make me a successful student at your university."
"Engineering has always captured my imagination; from the enormity that is the Airbus A380 to the minute workings of a computer circuit board, I have always been inspired to develop my understanding of the world around me, through my passion for Engineering.
By undertaking work experience in a variety of engineering fields, I have been able to see a practical use for the skills that I have developed during my A Level studies. My work placement at BMI gave me a firsthand insight into the implementation of physics and mathematics in real life situations.
Calculating fuel payloads on the Airbus A330 gave me the determination to improve on my performance in Mathematics now that I have a better understanding of the relevance of each unit.
Moreover, I appreciated the complexity of computer programming and electrical engineering during my placement at Flight Safety International, where all aspects of engineering are brought together to generate type-rated simulators.
Finally, I thoroughly enjoyed my placement at Mercedes Benz, where I was also able to see the importance of physics in everyday engineering, as well as the appreciation for clever and innovative design, this gave me motivation throughout my Product Design course.
Alongside my school work, I have been able to participate in numerous extra-curricular activities, such as the Gold D of E Award, where I was able to extend my leadership abilities by completing the Community Sports Leadership Award. As part of this course we, as a group of five, were responsible for delivering the PE lessons for a class of Year 6 pupils.
This additional responsibility helped me to hone my time management skills. I completed the skill aspect of the Award by competing in the Young Enterprise competition. This helped to support my studies in Economics as it gave me the insight into the links between the producer and the consumer markets.
The connection between the two sectors is vitally important for the success of the engineering sector. Studying Physics at A Level, I took the opportunity to travel to Paris to learn about the practical side of Physics through lectures lead by experts in their field. In particular, I was fascinated by the lecture on Artificial Intelligence and the exploration of Mars.
I like to immerse myself in all areas of school life. After entering the Sixth Form I took the additional role of being a Head of House. I primarily helped to motivate the younger members of the school in their school competitions.
My rapport with the younger years was endorsed by my involvement in running the Year 7 football team. As a Prefect, I was in charge of ensuring that the rules of the school were adhered to during lunch time. Being able to extend my leadership and management qualities at school has made my part time work as a Life Guard much easier, as I can now manage the safety of bathers in a more efficient manner.
My enthusiasm for Engineering has been enhanced by attending a taster course at UCL; this helped to cement my commitment to studying Engineering at degree level.
After completing my degree, I intend to join the British Army as an Officer in the Parachute Regiment.
Through my long term membership of the Air Cadets, I have been able to complete a Gliding Scholarship; having this military flying experience has made my choice to pursue a military career clearer, knowing that hard work and dedication to doing your job well is thoroughly rewarded in the military.
I believe that I am ideal to study Engineering at university as I have devoted time away from school to further my interest in Engineering.
By regularly reading the New Scientist magazine, I have been able to submerge myself in all areas of science and technology.
As a result of this I feel I have accumulated a substantial background knowledge that will allow me to fit into the diverse topics of degree level Engineering."
"The world of engineering is so complex, yet so inspiring. Incredibly, engineers are discovering more ingenious and inventive solutions to complicated problems, whilst continually maximising efficiency.
It is my aspiration to pursue a career in engineering, contributing creative answers to challenging questions and improving on existing designs, with the aim to maximise efficiency without compromising on functionality or stability.
To tie in with my desire for efficiency, one of my most valued pass times is Parkour. Parkour is the art of moving yourself from position A to B by the most efficient means available, overcoming any obstacles.
For example, rather than walking around a far-reaching wall, Parkour encourages you to take the initiative and jump over it instead. I value the idea that you can always exercise a dynamic approach towards accomplishing a task, achieving a more efficient outcome. And it is this belief that drives me towards my goal of becoming a credible engineer.
I find engineering to be such an attractive topic. The underlying problem solving and logical thinking involved plays a key role in my enjoyment of the subject. I am fascinated that something as common as the petrol engine can contain such elaborate and precise engineering but be continually improved.
I greatly appreciate the effort put in to squeezing those extra joules of energy from an already highly efficient source of motion, ultimately providing a better fuel economy for consumers.
With the skills and experience gained from studying at your university, I hope to make my mark in the engineering world by offering alternative and efficient solutions to common, and uncommon, engineering problems.
Throughout my years at high school, I have developed skills and qualities that I would deem invaluable to my school and future work aspirations.
During the earlier years of secondary school, I learnt a lot from teachers and senior pupils both academically and emotionally. I always admired the dedication that some enthusiastic senior pupils had for the school.
This helped motivate me to make my own personal impact as opposed to taking the back seat. This year I stepped up to the roles of House Captain, Prefect and chair of the yearbook committee. I was chosen to represent all three positions and aim to actively express my abilities to the school's benefit.
Not only do I take pride in making a positive difference, but the whole experience has granted me the chance to gain vital skills and knowledge for use later in life. This includes leading the yearbook committee, under pressure, to meet deadlines. I have also honed skills in public and group speaking, acting as House Captain.
As a prefect, I volunteered to mentor an S1 pupil by supporting him with studies and being there for him when he needed someone to talk to.
This experience has taught me the value of being a responsible and reliable adult, with the added knowledge that I have helped someone, on a personal level, to aspire towards their individual goals.
At the age of 15, Royal Mail accepted me into a one-week work experience placement which involved working in various departments.
This opportunity allowed me to adapt to different situations while performing to the best of my ability. The team work and time management involved throughout the week also provided the chance to build upon my existing skill set.
My dedication and motivation towards engineering, and an enthusiastic approach towards life in general, can be summarised with this inspiring quote, ""don't ask for an easier life, ask to be a stronger person"".
This fuels my passion to go one step further and I strongly believe that studying at your university will lead to a challenging, but successful life and career."
"Being born as a son to two former engineers, I was raised in an environment where curiosity is treasured and nurtured.
It wasn't surprising that as I became older, my fascination towards science and technology also grew along with me.
My father -a mechanical engineer, turned corporate businessman - loves to tell me stories of how he would drive along the natural gas pipelines of Peninsular Malaysia and inspect the terminals where the compressor stations he helped designed were situated.
For a small village boy, stories of such strange machines intrigued me and it wasn't long before I started to turn to reading to feed this new hunger. I begged my parents to buy me books and encyclopedias with scientific articles the moment I knew how to read. My mother - an electrical engineer turned teacher - gladly complied. Eventually, reading became a hobby.
However, later on, during my late teens, I began to realise that such knowledge can only be useful if I use it for the sake of helping others and the environment. While I was in college, I volunteered in a program to motivate orphans of a rural village called Kampung Jijan.
I also searched for other ways to help out, play a part in society but there were too many problems on the face of the Earth that I couldn't decide at all. It wasn't until my final year in secondary school that I finally chose a cause to work for.
The whole cycle of extracting, processing and distributing petroleum has always given an impact on not just the environment but also towards the economy. Looking back on my father's job inspired me to one day develop a greener and more sustainable system of extraction and processing. I believe a career in mechanical engineering would be the best way to do so as it has varying degrees of roles in the industry.
From then on, with a goal in mind, I worked as hard as I could in studying and succeeded in getting straight A's with 7A+ in my SPM (Malaysian Certificate of Education). Soon after, I was able to land a scholarship with MARA (Indigenous People's Trust Council) to continue my studies in A-level.
In the effort to better improve myself, I ran for the Student Representative Council of my college and was elected as the Executive Council of Student Welfare. During my term, I founded the Student Welfare Bureau as a volunteering platform for students to become involved in improving the standard of living in the institution.
This position had given me the opportunity to hone my leadership skills and learn the traits of a leader as I lead the members of my bureau. Due to the overwhelming workload, I also had to learn to juggle my responsibilities efficiently.
Furthermore, I have entered various competitions such as The Star-English Speaking Union Malaysia Public Speaking Competition 2011 to further enhance my oratory and argumentative skills.
With determination and hard work, I successfully emerged as a finalist for the competition and was featured in several articles ( http://goo.gl/LXVf8 and http://goo.gl/ALqsq ) in The Star newspaper for my speeches which were entitled ""Independence 101"" and ""Flavours"".
In addition, I also organised a tour for my classmates and me to the PETRONAS Melaka Refinery Complex - an important source of crudes and condensates in Malaysia - where we learnt in further details the process of offshore oil drilling and fractional distillation.
I am confident in my abilities to fulfill my goals but I admit that I am lacking in experiences and knowledge.
However, I believe that all these can be obtained once I enter one of the five prominent universities I have chosen in the UK.
I hope that I will be selected as a student of mechanical engineering as this would certainly help turn my aspirations of becoming a professional engineer into a reality and contribute towards the betterment of the environment and my country's people."
"The rapid advancement in engineering technologies over the past century has radically changed the way we live. These technologies have not only brought about positive change but also a mosaic of interrelated problems that afflict us socially, economically and ecologically.
I believe that engineers should incorporate management views and economic expertise as part of their curricular to effectively manage their practices and find creative solutions. This will not only improve our standards of living but this ensures a legacy for the future generation. I intend to pursue a career in Engineering and Management so that I can be part of this quest to modernise our lives.
Since this career explores the diverse nature of engineering practices, I wish to acquire and comprehend the techniques that are employed in this array of fields. I believe it's a challenging career which creates wealth and adds value to the places we live and work.
Growing up I have looked up to engineers as my role models and I have always aspired to be one myself. My passion for science dates back to when I was in grade school. An aptitude for physics and mathematics enabled me to excel in all my science subjects at O-level.
Throughout the 4 years I was an O-level student I was proud to take part in several science projects. The projects that intrigued me most were that of a model windmill, a solar cooker and that of a model water pump. These in particular made me aware of how new technology must be introduced into society without hurting our environment.
In 2006, I was drafted into a 4 member bridge building team. We competed representing our school with 8 other schools and came out 5th. Although we did not win, it was an invaluable challenge. As I progressed to A-level, I took Maths, Physics and Chemistry as my combination of subjects to utilize the aptitude I had for these subjects.
Despite the fact that teachers were sometimes a shortage, I never lost hope because I knew I could take the challenge. Much of my learning at A-level was based on presentations we did as a class alternatively on each topic to effectively utilize each others knowledge. We attended seminars with other schools to exchange views and ideas on these subjects.
I was thrilled by how closely related the 3 subjects are and I figured out how they create a strong base for a variety of careers. I found the practical lessons exciting as they involved putting ideas into concrete terms and how to communicate observations. This tough learning experience taught me not to depend much on teachers but to research ahead on every topic that I am studying.
Apart from my academic studies I also had some extra curricular activities at heart. From 2005 to 2009 I was in the school athletics team. I partook in short marathon competitions and I also did high jump. I was also the school's football team medic. Sometimes I joined the team when they were practicing.
Away from the sporting fields, I was a member of the Interact Club. In 2008 and 2009 much of the club's activities were organized by me as I was Project Coordinator.
Being a member of the Environmental Awareness Campaign Club taught me that for the survival of our planet we must learn to strike a balance between development needs and environmental protection. I feel obliged to be part of the engineers who are working tirelessly to avert the threat of global warming.
Under the activities of this club I planted 3 Mopane trees during my final year on the National Tree Planting Day. It is rather unfortunate for me as I could not acquire any work experience from 2010 up to now due to the unexpected circumstances that prevailed here in Zimbabwe. I have spent much of my time reading novels and National Geographic.
For me pursuing this Engineering and Management degree is the realisation of a dream. I am looking forward to face the challenges of university life both academically and socially. I can only feel that my dream aspiration is now within grasp."
"I have always been an academic and studious person; it is my innovative and inquisitive nature however that compels me to study at university.
At a young age, whilst taking apart lawnmowers and old mopeds in the shed with my father, I discovered a natural understanding for mechanics.
Often I made simple Rube Goldberg machines around the house and although I dreamt of being a more successful inventor, my lack of scientific knowledge rendered my intuition and creativity unsuccessful! It was not until A levels that I really began to understand the physical world mathematically and apply some basic theories.
Although I achieved good grades, I find myself eager to understand topics that were not covered such as the mechanics of fluid.
My desire to understand how things work has also advanced to the laws of the universe. Although I was excited to learn of Newton's laws of motion, more counter-intuitive theories like those of Einstein's relativity fascinate me as they were derived from such basic principles.
Material like this improves my own skill in theoretical and mathematical deduction that may help me understand ideas necessary for an Engineering course. I have also acquired advanced skills in computing.
Combined with my enthusiasm for problem solving and statistics, this might be useful for modelling/CAD and data analysis. Recently I purchased two touch screen tills from a closing shop and converted one into a jukebox.
The other I made into a loop machine to aid my love of music composition and production. I have a keen interest in sports too, particularly sailing where I compete at European level.
This lets me experience a sense of achievement, team spirit and international friendships. I also believe that my instinct for the effects of wind and drag greatly improve my ability.
Throughout my schooling I have participated in many fund raising events and open days. At the age of 12 I organised a charity day with minimal assistance and was allocated part of the school budget to buy equipment.
I both enjoyed and took my responsibilities seriously and among my contributions to life at high school, I had an active role in the Council and the 'Listeners' (supporting victims of bullying). I also helped the headmaster write the School Travel Plan, took part in the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Expedition and received a Silver Certificate in the UKMT Mathematics Challenge.
My experience working for Marks and Spencer as a sales assistant was valuable as the company required great communication skills. I was then taken on permanently in their Bureau de Change during my A levels. This required me to organise my time efficiently but also greatly improved my mental arithmetic.
During my work experience at ARUP, a prestigious London architecture company, I decided instead to pursue a career that involved some aspect of motion. The things I learnt working alongside civil engineers about structural analysis, materials and design however may still be applicable to my course.
During my gap year so far I have grown in both confidence and maturity. Currently in New Zealand, I have gained work experience with a hydraulic solutions company.
My interest in this area has grown greatly and helped consolidate and support my desire to study Mechanical Engineering at degree level. In 2008 I was excited to hear of Geoff Barnett's simple solution to congestion when Google invested in his 'Shweeb'.
During my time here I have visited the prototype track near Rotorua and was inspired by its efficiency. I am now more aware of the opportunities for improvements that exist in almost everything around us and look forward to expressing and developing my own ideas and designs to make those improvements.
Mechanical Engineering is something that I could really be passionate about as a career and studying its range of stimulating topics at a good university will give me the wealth of knowledge and skills that I need to achieve this."
"From a very young age I was intrigued by projectiles. Always wondering why if I threw an object, it would inevitably return to the ground no matter how hard I tried.
Such queries kept me captivated throughout my youth and are probably what motivates my enjoyment in physics today.
The strong drive that makes me want to pursuit a career in mechanics all developed whilst studying forces during my third and fourth year of high school.
Learning about such things as the Newton balance, conservation of energy and laws of motion all intrigued me and stimulated me to learn and picture myself one day pursuing a career involving the more complex dimensions of mechanics.
Reading prospectuses and talking to students, plus family members and family friends with degrees in different aspects of engineering, helped me to finalize my decision in choosing mechanical engineering as I course I wanted to be involved with. Deep-water and Subsea technologies is just one of the sectors of mechanics that I wouldparticularly enjoy specialising in.
Hearing stories told by my grandfather about his past work on oil rigs only fascinated me further. Having a keen interest in scuba diving, I feel that specialising in Deep-water technologies would be just one aspect of mechanics I would be interested to further enhance my knowledge.
Last summer I participated in the South Lanarkshire MSD Pharmaceutical challenge in which many pupils from several schools were given a lecture on Alzheimer's disease and how it affects the brain.
In groups of three, we all had to come up with a presentation on what we had been taught during the day and in the end my group came second. This was a very interesting day as I got to observe how lectures were presented and the way in which the information was taught.
Working as a team to complete and present a project was a great experience, also learning that this subject matter ""was not the one for me"" was a very useful part of the day.
Working part time in ""Savers"" has drastically improved my communication skills, patience and most of all my confidence in working with others. Experiencing unexpected challenges daily makes my work enjoyable and makes everyday different.
I am a very friendly outgoing individual. My interests consist mainly that of sport, such as badminton, cycling and golf, but I also enjoy reading and more recently cooking. I am a member of both the school and a local badminton club. I enjoy competing in competitions as well as practising with friends and family.
Teaching younger, less experienced players is a very rewarding experience as it gives me a sense of achievement when they win a game and use techniques I have personally shown them. It is a fantastic feeling to see someone you have spent time with succeed.
Along with teaching badminton, I also play a wide variety of musical instruments, some of which I play at school concerts with my band. Being in a band taught me how perform as a team which meant no egocentricity was allowed!
After achieving a degree in mechanics, I would use the knowledge that I gained during the course and develop it further through the application in our working society.
Believing I will be able to cope with the amount of work given to myself, I am applying to your university due to its fantastic reputation, culture, human resources and tangible assets.
I believe the requirements to succeed in university have a far greater priority then that of the activities I enjoy doing, therefore my academic commitment would always take priority."
"Overcoming economic hurdles tempered by ecological limits requires innovative solutions. For centuries mathematical and analytical skills have fused to solve practical problems.
The diverse nature of engineering has made advancements possible in an array of fields from the wheel to The International Space Station. I would be honoured to join this remarkable group of people in their quest to change our lives for the better.
For me, the pursuit of engineering is the realisation of a dream. It is about being true to myself - responding to a desire to do what I enjoy doing. An aptitude for maths and physics allows me to appreciate the idea engineers can start with numbers and finish with physical results.
The application of aeronautical engineering in particular is of special interest. In 100 years, flight has progressed from the ground-breaking efforts of the Wright brothers, to the awe-inspiring and economical Boeing 787. I want to learn more: not just about how aircraft stay in the air, but how the propulsion systems get them there.
The diversity of aerodynamics is equally intriguing. It applies not only to aircraft, but to rockets, cruise liners and F1 cars. I find even the more humble projects just as compelling: the sense of achievement I draw from assembling an IKEA table makes me wonder how it must feel to look at a bridge, a skyscraper or a fighter jet and think– I helped build that. My interest in engineering has stemmed from my subject choices for Leaving Certificate. Though I always had a way with numbers, applied maths has shown me the practical application of mathematical skills. I find this type of problem-solving satisfying - I can visualise a definite outcome.
Physics and Chemistry have given me an insight into how things work at the smallest of levels: as I write, we are studying the intricacies of the Internal Combustion Engine which is fascinating.
In First Year I represented my school at national level in a maths competition and was ranked among the top 50 in the country. As a result of my high Junior Certificate grade, I was selected for the International Maths Olympiad programme at University College Cork. The course was challenging but rewarding.
I believe in the importance of seizing every opportunity to get involved in extra-curricular activities which have broadened my horizons. During the Transition Year (TY) programme, I ranked highly in public speaking competitions, EU project work and a mini-company competition.
The process of taking an idea from conception through completion ties closely with engineering, which was, I think, why I drew such enjoyment and pride from it. Part of my TY programme involved work experience at Cork Airport and voluntary work with The Irish Guide Dogs.
I value making a difference– as co-chairman of the Student Council, I founded the school “buddy” system, which pairs final year students with incoming first years. Being an active member of Cork County Youth Council has thought me the importance of democratic systems and speaking out for my peers.
Outside of school activities, I have a thirst for adventure. I believe in making every single day count. Making it count for me has included parapenting, water-skiing, white-water rafting and two skydives.
I have a passion for water sports and have completed all ISA dinghy sailing courses. I am equally passionate about music – I play flute to a grade 6 standard, and am a member of Cork County Youth Orchestra. However, piano (both classical and contemporary) has always been my main instrument of choice and I will sit my final exam in May.
Like most teenagers – TV plays a part in my life but even Friends takes a back seat when Mega Engineering or How It Works comes on.
The pursuit of engineering as an undergraduate would be the realisation of a dream. Pioneering dreams require ambition, determination and a vision for the future. I want to help shape that future."
"According to S.R. Covey, in his book 'Seven Habits of Highly Effective People', one of the key traits to accomplish any task is to begin with the end in mind and work accordingly to achieve it.
Many students inherently practice this from childhood till the actual time of choosing field arrives. Whereas a multitude of disciplines were discussed by my friends as their dreams, mine was just being, irrespective of field, at the top; hence my field was to be the one that I would be best at.
As the years passed, I performed consistently well in mathematics and developed a lot of interest in it. But one thing that pinched me the most was 'Why am I doing this? What's the use of trigonometry, vectors, matrices etc?'
Gradually, by every passing year, the interdependency of science and mathematics became evident; I discovered the extensive usage of mathematics in physics; the simple usage of dot product and cross product in physics formulae and of elementary row operations on matrices in solving complex electric circuits etc.
As a result, the mysteries that I used to mull over started to unfold and the application of what seemed useless in the past became vivid.
Gradually I started loving physics in general and electricity and magnetism in particular. Observing the extreme utility of electronics everywhere and seeing it as the widest based and ever growing field, I have chosen electrical engineering as my discipline for undergraduate studies.
My deep interest and fascination for this field led me to acquire some basic knowledge about logic circuits and their applications; this ultimately won me prizes in science exhibitions and competitions based on projects like infra red burglar alarm, light dependent circuit for automatic switching of lights where necessary to save power, a prototype of a wind turbine and a fun game based on an electronically operated water gun with sound sensors which laid heavy suppressive fire on anyone who was too loud!
The immense thirst for this field made me deeply sincere towards my academic life which consequently resulted in my worth mentioning success. I scored 'A' grade in 11 GCE O-Level subjects which included a world top in mathematics.
I was awarded two gold medals in my O-Level graduation ceremony for student of the year and best leaving student.
Moreover, I have successfully made it to the top seventeen of the National Physics Talent Contest (NPTC) and will compete further for a place in top five in order to be a member of the national team which will represent Pakistan in the 39th IPhO to be held in Vietnam.
Furthermore, I was awarded with fifty thousand rupees cash prize from General Pervaiz Musharraf, the president of Pakistan, in a ceremony held in the presidency in July 2007 to acknowledge the achievement of world toppers in GCE O and A-level examinations from all over Pakistan.
In my leisure time I have always preferred playing sports; my favourites being cricket and table-tennis.
I have actively participated in every sporting events held on and off campus. I have also been involved in social work which includes serving CARE (a social welfare organization), collecting donations for the victims of the devastating earthquake of 8th October, 2005. I was also a member of the World Wide Walden project.
As for my future, I definitely don't want to limit my education to a mere bachelors; instead I want to continue my education till a doctorate degree and make some valuable and unique contribution to my field. The aims which I have can only be fulfilled in an environment which is friendly, research oriented and is conducive to my aims.
All universities in UK in particular have a culture with these traits. Having been taught all subjects in English has given me command over the language which will eliminate any chances of communication hurdles.
Therefore, UK is my prime priority for Undergraduate as well as any higher degree in my course of studies."
"Physics is that branch of science without which science is just like a beautiful lamp with no light. For centuries, mathematicians and physicists have made plenty of scientific contributions thus helping the world make a better place to live.
From the works of Isaac Newton to the discoveries of Einstein, the engineering world has taken a giant leap in advancement. This great modernization demonstrates that engineering is full of challenges and this is why I'm fascinated and curious to study it in detail.
I've been inquisitive to study physics and mathematics and thus try to picture them in my daily life. Thoughts of Mechanics and dynamics enter my mind whenever I walk, slip, witness an accident or throw a ball in a projectile motion. Getting inspired from Faraday has sustained my interests in electronics; his incredible invention of the first transformer and his laws of electromagnetism which are widely used today marks him as a true genius.
Apart from this, willing to be updated of the current physical research, I never leave a word unread in the weekly science newspaper; it involves new interesting technologies and I've found the article 'little electricity, more mileage' to be thrilling as it explained how newly manufactured electric cars can self-charge themselves, run for miles in a one-time battery charge and had horsepower equivalent to that of high-performance vehicles!.
I've also participated in a math project in which I tried to invent a way to find areas of irregular shapes, although it was a hard thing to do but I never gave up.
After lots of research, I came up with a rather funny yet valuable idea, to draw small squares of known areas and fit them in the irregular shape to find the overall approximate area. It wasn't a success but it strengthened my desires to pursue mathematics at undergraduate level.
Moreover, O and A level have given me an excellent insight into engineering and I find the courses intriguing. I enjoy diversity in learning and therefore plan to study economics at AS-level as well. Self-studying various topics out of curiosity in mathematics and physics has also helped me develop an independent approach towards studies. Becoming a math and physics tutor has allowed me to extend engineering beyond classroom.
Sometimes, teaching becomes even more challenging when my student shows agility in problem solving. Moreover, I've been chosen in a 'student a.k.a teacher' scheme in which our teacher chose the best students in class and they were asked to teach a whole class of 30 students professionally.
I've also been selected as a monitor for my class for an year in which I had to manage and record the class's attendance, exam performances and behavior. These participations as well as teaching has enhanced my qualities of working under pressure, confidence, interactive as well as leadership skills and helped me earn several achievement certificates. Furthermore, I'm also enthusiastic about art and used it to create pollution and global warming awareness during school life and have successfully received a third position.
My extracurriculars involve challenging others across the globe with games like scrabble and anagram. Cricket is my favorite sport and I've played a vital role in my team's performance thus achieving the best bowler award. Reading fiction is part of my lifestyle and I've tons of novels. I also surf the net and mostly love to read about the works and lives of great scientists.
Therefore, I believe that a degree from the UK will give me exciting opportunities to witness the challenging adventures engineering has to offer thus transforming me into a leading engineer.
I plan to move on towards research after graduation to fulfill my desires to revolutionize the engineering world hence establishing myself as a role model for my university as well as for my country where I'll adopt every possible approach to make learning physics and mathematics fun and easily accessible for all."
"From a young age I have always been wondering how things work. I usually tried to improve things by making them more efficient or by adjusting their functionality.
At that time I didn’t actually know what engineering was. I gained a real interest in engineering by watching the TV series such as “How it’s made” or “How do they do it?”. These shows give insight into the way in which many things, from microwave ovens through cars to space shuttles, are done or how they work.
My first contact with a little more serious engineering was when I got a small radio construction set. It only had a few capacitors, resistors and a simple earphone and a speaker, but building it and actually receiving any broadcast was a very rewarding feeling after the time spent assembling it.
This is like a mathematical problem. When solving a problem, you start with a simple set of analogies, but you can find the solution even to a very complex problem.
Another practical experience was a contribution to the IDEERS Earthquake Resistant Buildings competition. The objective of the project was to design and construct a model of a building that could stand a model situation of an earthquake.
This project enhanced the ability to work in a team and tested whether we were able to successfully transfer the knowledge from our Math and Physics lessons into real world situations.
My interest in sciences, primarily physics and mathematics, provides me with the foundations needed for in-depth understanding of problems related to this field.
I believe that this is an important part of engineering; understanding how and why things work. Understanding how things work is vital when they stop working, so we are able to find and eliminate the defect or defects and make necessary modifications.
That is why I decided to become an engineer; to help lead the changing of the world, not just to follow. I believe that this can be achieved by obtaining a certain degree of education, which only a good university can provide.
I have always liked to read about great engineers such as Thomas Edison or Nikola Tesla, but the one that perhaps was the most futuristic for his times was Leonardo DaVinci. The fact that I admire about him the most is that for his age he was able to produce inventions that were proved to be functional many hundreds of years later.
Unfortunately, he didn’t have the technical means to construct many of them. Occasionally, I part-timed at my father’s company, where I worked with numbers. I wasn’t maybe as fast or skilled as the full-time employees, but I always had all the numbers correct. This proved another, perhaps a very important quality needed in engineering, preciseness.
Apart from school, I enjoy sports. Either passively as a spectator, usually football or hockey, or actively, actually doing the sport. The ones I do, include cycling, exercising in the gym, and karate.
My command of English is excellent: I have been attending English speaking schools throughout the whole process of education, from elementary to secondary education, which has thoroughly prepared me for University studies in English.
By studying in the UK I seek the opportunity to gain a superior education to that which any Slovak university could offer.
I am able to work either independently or as a part of a team. I think that I can withstand the pressure that is awaiting me, and I really look forward to facing the challenges that studying internationally will bring."
"In a world that overwhelmingly recognizes climate change as a dangerous threat and has become wary of the shortcomings of fossil fuels and the fact that they’re depleting at an alarming rate, pressures are building on modern industry and businesses to become greener and more sustainable.
This would mean innovating new eco-friendly products and diversifying into new renewable energy sources.
Engineers would undoubtedly have an immense role in this new global challenge. Hence, my interest in both renewable energy and engineering made me realize that I could contribute significantly to a global crisis.
My interest and aptitude in science and mathematics have grown profusely over the past few years as I always seeked logical solutions to everyday problems and enjoyed taking up new challenges.
The curiosity that I had led me to investigate how things functioned , which often left me fascinated by the science, particularly physics, which lay hidden in the contraptions.
Engineering is a field which often paves the way for new discoveries through the large amount of research that it involves, which is what interests me the most.
Though I am aware of the patience, challenges and the amount of risk taking that confront engineers, I believe a career in engineering best suits my abilities and interests.
The subjects that I take at school only fuelled my motivation more. Studying mathematics and further mathematics helped me improve my problem solving skills and become more confident in taking up new challenges. I also learnt how certain branches of mathematics were involved in the world of engineering.
In studying chemistry, I was made aware of new concepts like green chemistry, kinetics and thermodynamics which would influence modern industry. It also made me think outside of the box as to how molecules behave. It made me think about the possibility of nuclear energy becoming a potential source of renewable energy.
Though biology may seem irrelevant to study for an engineering student, I was impressed at the knowledge it gave me about mechanisms used by different organisms in order to survive.
Sometimes, these mechanisms form the basis of how useful devices, such as aeroplanes function. It also provided me an insight to the impact of global warming on the world’s ecosystems.
This encouraged even more to work towards a solution. Physics, being one of my favourite subjects, greatly enhanced my knowledge by explaining the various phenomena surrounding us and how they could be used in order to accelerate the growth of technology. For example, how Newton’s laws of motion are used in rocket propulsion or how total internal reflection makes optical fibres useful in communications.
To further my interest and knowledge of both renewable energy and engineering, I spent over a month at the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority where I learnt about emerging technologies, particularly wind energy.
I became familiar with the way in which wind turbines function such as the aerodynamic principles of the rotor blades and how the blade speed is kept in check by pitch and yaw controls.
However, I also realised the increasingly important role of economics in engineering, (in this case how it influences the growth of the wind energy industry) how engineers try to minimize costs of transport, installation and materials while retaining efficiency of the system.
The authority also organized an energy exhibition where I got to do voluntary work and got a chance to educate the Sri Lankan public about simple ways to cut down electricity bills, greener household solutions and how to lead a more eco-friendly lifestyle.
Outside of my school curriculum, I am enthusiastic about learning new languages. I am already fluent in English and Sinhala while I can converse quite well in Norwegian and French. I recently began a beginner course in German at the Goethe Institut in Colombo.
I wish to learn more languages along with my engineering degree as I believe linguistic ability is an important skill for an engineer to have. This would increase my chances of employability and allow me to work in different countries.
To continually update my knowledge about science and technology, I often read science magazines such as National Geographic and New Scientist. This also exposes me to a range of new ideas allowing me to think in different ways and hopefully would benefit my future research work.
The standard of higher education and quality of research is the main reason I chose the UK to pursue my tertiary education. Having followed all academic work in English, I believe that I am competent enough to follow a degree course taught entirely in English.
After completing an Engineering degree, tooled with both the technical and interpersonal skills that I have gained at university, I am determined to make a significant contribution to scientific research, renewable energy in particular, to create a more energy secure future."
"I grew up as a boy who loves robots and motorbikes very much. Thus, I love things that move especially those that are related to engines.
I started to be really passionate about mechanical engineering when I learned about the control system when I was in high school. I simply enjoyed learning about the hydraulics and pneumatics system.
Though it is only a small branch of mechanical engineering, it utterly grabbed my attention. From then onwards, I always dreamed of handling massive machinery that involves hydraulics and pneumatics as I found it irresistible. In fact, I have always wanted to study things that involved movement, coordination and are visible with my bare eyes.
Besides that, I believe that I can apply my mathematical knowledge very well and with my true passion towards physics, I believe that being an engineer is the perfect career for me.
I have always described myself as an inquisitive person. I am very curious to learn something new. In fact, I can speak and write French quite well. I had taken DELF A2 which is the proficiency test for non-native speaker. Gratefully, I passed it with flying colours.
Besides that, I used to be active outside the classroom. I had represented my school for National English Camp and National French Carnival in 2005 and 2006. Basically, these two events involved many activities such as quizzes, presentations, debates, group activities and so on. These activities had made me more outspoken.
Plus, I am aware that a first-class engineer needs to have excellent teamwork spirit, great leadership and able to work under pressure. In fact, the skill to work in groups will be the core for a good result in university.
I am confident that I can always collaborate with others. I was involved in a marching band and orchestra when I was in high school, and I was the assistant conductor for 2 years and the conductor for about 6 months.
This experience taught me how to act as a team and get rid of my egocentricity and selfishness. It also taught me to be emphatic and prepared me for the job of an engineer which can be extremely challenging.
In addition, being the conductor had heightened my leadership and communication skills tremendously. Thus, it is an advantage for the latter stage of my life.
For fact, my hobby is cooking. I love to try different menus. However, recently I have started learning a few magic tricks from my friend and my growing interest in it has made it my new hobby. These two hobbies actually represent my true colours. I am a willing learner and I always challenge myself with something new.
Regarding my interest, I really admire Ernst Werner Von Siemens. For me he is the epitome of what an engineer should be. His contribution in the field of telecommunications and power generation was astounding. I really hope that one day; I will be able to direct my own engineering firm like Siemens did. Besides, I have always dreamed to have a chance to specialise in the field of instrumentation.
My aspiration is to learn about the Micro-Electro Mechanical System (MEMS). Personally, I think that this new technology has a bright prospect ahead. Therefore, having the qualification from your university is the very first step for me to achieve my goal.
Despite all the cutting-edge technology in this modern world today, we are actually consuming an enormous amount of natural resources. This scenario will consequently lead to problems related to waste material and pollutant which makes the world less sustainable.
In accordance with this situation, I think that engineer should take charge to solve this environmental issue and find the best alternative as a solution. Therefore it is in my passion to study mechanical engineering to help make Earth a greener world so that our next generation will inherit the planet in superb condition.
Lastly, I hope that a degree from your university will be the ultimate foundation for my journey to becoming a superior engineer.

"I had discovered it in the early years of life, the solution to quench my thirst for knowledge, is to pursue Mechanical Engineering as my career.
Opting for such a degree will not only ease my frustration, but will facilitate me in accomplishing my passion, and following my dreams. Someone who is fortified with the art of manipulating numbers, in a useful way, can conquer any problem - even 1+1=11.
Mathematics has justified my belief as a main facet in Mechanical Engineering. Analysing different problems has broadened my thinking perspective, and amplified my scrutinising powers.
As a child I was fascinated by the subject of mathematics, was never quite able to grasp the complexities but was attracted to it none the less, but as I grew older my understanding of the subject increased and so did its charm for me.
I took Mathematics as a principle subject in my O level and chose Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Further Mathematics as my A level subjects. These subjects broadened my horizons and enhanced my analytical skills. Furthermore, they fulfill the pre-requisite of engineering.
During my work experience, I have learnt skills which would guide me in the years to come. My work experience at Digital World Pakistan (DWP) Pvt. Ltd. has taught me to cope with real life situations and problems. I learnt essential time management skills that will help me in my future life.
Through my experience at my father’s company, Crown Winding Wires, I learnt to draw and enamel copper wires, and helped my fellow employees in the laboratory. This direct interaction with engineering science has given me the necessary practical experience to understand scientific concepts at a practical level.
Apart from my academic achievements, I took part in diversified co-curricular activities. I am a member of the student council and hold the office of the General Secretary of the Science Society. I have been part of designing and constructing many workable models and have organized various science fairs at the college campus.
A membership in the council has enabled me to develop leadership qualities and a sense of responsibility. At the moment, I am helping our community services society, IRTIQA, to raise funds for earthquake victims of Baluchistan.
I believe sports play an integral role in character building. It can teach one many lessons implicitly that can never be taught explicitly by any institution. Due to this belief I actively participated in almost all sports related activities that were provided at my school. These activities made me feel relieved from my hectic college routine.
I was enlisted for my college cricket team and it helped me in relaxing after the tiring academic schedule. In my leisure, I also play table tennis and football. I have represented my college at various sport galas.
In the coming years, I see myself graduating as a mechanical engineer. Excelling in the field of mechanical engineering is challenging and a life-long career; it would give me a sense of self-actualization and satisfaction of my intellectual cravings.
Studying in the British system would not only develop my personality but would enrich me with cultural values that the British institutions are known for.
Through planned academic management, I see myself graduating from a world-class university, in the coming bright and enlightening years."
"Questions regarding the reason for my liking of mathematics have only one answer: mathematical logic and concepts contribute to a practical approach in every aspect of life.
It is the diversity and universal applicability of this subject that encourages me to delve further and study it in depth. It will provide a strong foundation for the range of careers that I wish to pursue after graduation.
Due to some problems I was not diligent student in grade 7 and 8. This affected my grades as expected. Based on those grades, my mathematics teacher advised me not to pursue Additional Mathematics at O levels.
Despite this discouragement, I decided to stick with my decision and work diligently during my O levels. I took this as a challenge and scored 8A’s in O level with an A in Additional mathematics at 98th percentile which was the highest in my school.
This inspiration encouraged me to sit for the entire A level Mathematic in the first year of my A level. Completing the entire subject in this reduced span and scoring an A grade was a cumbersome task but my aptitude for mathematics made complex problems seem interesting and finally allowed me to achieve an ‘A’ Grade in A level mathematics.
After all this I realised that throughout my life, I have always found a way to succeed, regardless of the obstacles placed before me. As a result, I am a firm believer that nothing could be taken for granted. I know that all that I accomplish and achieve must be earned.
More than just achieving good grades, I wanted to develop a practical approach to my professional life. I worked for a rice factory where I developed their entire website and managed the accounts. Although it was difficult to carry out the internship due to its location and my academic priorities but the calculations were challenging and rewarding to perform.
Apart from this I also got the chance to work for Net Sol Technologies Inc. as a web designer’s assistant. These valuable experiences taught me the importance of being adept with numbers and computers and have convinced me to pursue a related career.
I am the founder and the current president of the society for Information Technology at my college. As the President, I have been successful in grooming and budding new talent. I have also organized a number of I.T events including a graphic designing competition which was greatly appreciated by the participants of other schools.
This has polished my leadership qualities and has taught me the importance of working as part of a team. I have learned to successfully balance my academic and co-curricular activities and I wish to continue with the same zeal at university.
I look forward to an exchange of ideas as I pursue an education in the UK. I envision myself as an ambassador for my country who can promote the exchange of students and professionals between Europe and South Asia. While Pakistan develops rapidly, the scope for ambitious individuals remain limited.
This is particularly true in mathematics and its related areas, which I wish to pursue. But I believe that committed people like myself can use our foreign training to create more opportunities for talented individuals. I have great passion for Mathematics and consider it integral to any career.
This education will not only give me the academic grounds to enter careers like actuarial science, financial mathematics and research, but the social experience in itself is something to look forward to.
I wish to continue my journey of learning at an institution with broad resources and diversity and then share my learning with millions that are deprived of a similar opportunity."
"Having had a successful 11 year career in the travel industry, it may seem a little peculiar that I am now applying to study engineering.
When I was younger, I had planned to become an engineer and at 16 I took an apprenticeship with the Royal Navy. Not liking the military lifestyle, I left the Navy a little disheartened and found a job working in a travel agency.
After a relatively rapid career progression, I was fortunate enough to have a superb position as a Promotions Manager for British Airways in New York. Within a few years though, I realised that my career was not where I wanted it to be and decided to finally train to be an engineer.
The thought of becoming an engineer excites me as I long to have a career that makes an impact. The idea of using physics to improve people's lives is thrilling. When I was a 'normal age' student, my passion for engineering was born from a love of finding out how things work under the hood. Being analytical, I was never satisfied with just using an object. I needed to know what was going on inside it.
More recently, I have become increasingly intrigued by the new wave of technology that is becoming more integrated into our daily lives.
I am particularly interested in nanotechnology and how it will shape our future. As the effect of nanotubes in electronics is still being researched, I very much look forward to studying them to create a new generation of super-technology. My goal is to be at the forefront of this technology, developing new solutions and making a real difference.
To ensure I have experience and understanding of the industry, I have become a student member of The IET. Their fortnightly magazine is filled with breakthroughs in research, real-world engineering problems and has been a great insight into the work of both commercial and academic engineers. Over the summer, I was also fortunate to receive an internship with EDF Energy.
This experience has been extremely useful as I have had the opportunity to work first hand with electrical engineers to discover what their day to day activities are, learn how engineering is used in the industry and attend some exciting visits to substations.
I have also tried to increase my academic knowledge of the subject by reading such books as ""Structures: Or Why Things Don't Fall Down"" and ""Invention by Design: How Engineers Get from Thought to Thing"". I particularly enjoyed the latter as it discussed the evolution of design for everyday objects such as paperclips and pencils. I had not previously thought of how much work goes into these seemingly insignificant items.
Returning to education has been an exhilarating experience. Although a little apprehensive prior to the start of my course, I have thoroughly enjoyed studying Maths, Further Maths and Physics.
Whilst researching how to return to education, I discovered early on that the engineering course is very rigorous. It became clear that an Access course would not provide me with enough skills to successfully begin the engineering degree. I have therefore chosen to complete two-year A level courses in these subjects. This has certainly been the right decision as I find myself challenged sufficiently and feel I will be fully prepared for higher education.
Outside of academics and my career, I enjoy several hobbies. I am a keen snowboarder and enjoyed spending an entire winter season in Vermont.
I also enjoy taking part in amateur dramatics and have been involved in many productions. In 2006, I completed a musical that I wrote and scored and was privileged to be given the opportunity to direct it for performance. After a successful first show I have continued to write and look forward to having the opportunity to stage another musical whilst at university."
"From a very young age, physics has always been a subject close to my heart. Back when I was in primary school it was space that captured my imagination, but as I’ve grown up the world of electronics has become the forerunner for my attention.
It is largely through electronics that the world has developed into something that would have been unrecognisable less than 100 years ago. It is my belief that electronic circuits are the primary reason that the number of patents filed each year has increased dramatically over time, and so to be a part of their development would be an incredibly rewarding situation.
It was at age 7 that I had my first memorable encounter with any form of electronic circuit, when the radio that my Dad had bought me fell from a shelf and broke, exposing the circuitry within.
Though I had no idea what any of the components were, they fascinated me. Their discovery led to years of prying the backs off of any devices I could find just so I could stare at the contents, even going so far as to open up a Gameboy I got one birthday before I actually attempted to play any of the games it had come with.
In terms of serious experience with electronic systems, the thing that most inspired me to pursue their study through to higher education was a 6-month series of extra lessons in my first year of sixth form.
The course was largely self-taught, with a tutor on hand to present problems and provide advice where needed. It resulted in producing a robot working on an IC556 pulse generator circuit that could navigate through long corridors and guide itself away from walls and obstacles, as well as an introduction to programming in Visual BASIC.
This project, as well as cementing my position on what to study at university, gave me a huge amount of experience in the kind of work that my course involves, and as such I feel gives me a head-start on getting to grips with the course details.
The main outlet for my passion for electronics has come about as a result of playing the guitar. As stocking up on enough components to be able to carry out projects at home would have been overly expensive, I instead turned to things that I already owned. Key amongst these was a guitar pedal I had been neglecting.
With the use of little else but a screwdriver I completely dismantled the pedal, and then reassembled it again with a neighbour’s soldering iron. To my continued amazement, it still works even now.
Besides these real experiences, I feel that I have a lot of the necessary skills required to succeed in an electronics degree course, most notably logical thinking skills and data management ability. In terms of logical thinking I feel
I have developed my skills in a number of ways, but perhaps the most important was through puzzle-based videogames. Often the problems you are presented seem insurmountable, but by thinking logically about the environment in which it takes place you can usually establish what it is you can do next.
This has also enabled me to develop a great deal of patience, and this is something I noticed was essential when I carried out the electronics course at school. It is often the case that one tiny problem requires a good deal of time spent searching for the solution, and so patience is most definitely a virtue.
Data-management is something I worked on by managing a fantasy football league amongst a few friends, and as such I now feel I am completely comfortable arranging data and transferring it between electronic and paper format.
Overall, I feel that an electronics course would be the best possible way in which I could further my passion into both higher education and a career beyond."
"My interest in technology began at a young age when I became curious about how the television worked. I didn't believe there were tiny people inside, as explained by my father, and with other appliances like the radio, I found myself eager to understand how they functioned.
I was particularly intrigued by the less tangible concepts like electricity and signals, and inquiring about such things increased my awareness of the technology around me. As a result, I have taken a keen interest in technology and its application in the modern world.
I began researching robotics after watching the movie Iron Man in 2008 that explored robotics, applied in bio-enhancement and notably flight. Though unrealistic for the most part, it was an eye opener to the field which is relatively unexplored.
Finding out about robots like ASIMO and DER2 really inspired me to delve into this engineering field; ASIMO has the best walking motion in any robot ever, and the smoothness of DER2's body movements and facial expressions is absolutely astonishing.
ASIMO in particular impressed me as I found out it maintained balance by shifting its weight in response to turning moments at different points in its anatomy. I studied moments in maths and physics and this was the first major application I saw of a subject I learnt.
Robotics is in its very early stages and requires a lot of research and development to be on par with the likes of aviation or automobile engineering. It poses a fresh engineering challenge as it requires the synergy of fields like mechanical and electronic engineering, and by studying this course I hope to contribute to robotics.
Key aspects like automation are studied in-depth within the systems and control module, which is vital for robots in making human interaction minimal. Methods of control are studied and assessed, involving the use of algorithms in programming different tasks and commands.
Algorithms particularly interest me as I studied matrices in further mathematics, and I hope to explore its use in programming and CAD. Many other useful subjects like materials and mechanics are studied, therefore providing a solid base for a future in robotics.
I am a very keen mathematician and have taken part in the UKMT mathematics challenge since year 10, achieving a Silver Certificate in last year's competition. My interest in the subject has aided my understanding of physics and should support study at degree level.
Sports-wise, I am a very keen player; through year 10 and 11, I played badminton, basketball and practiced judo. I play football more regularly now for my school team and started kickboxing last year, which I have practiced every week since.
During my GCSEs, I had a work placement at Spence, Harris and Hogan (SHH), an architectural and interior design Company. I worked with a team on ideas for a major design project and had to think critically to assess the ideas brought up.
For example, while planning the master bedroom, we had to consider the range of colours and artwork to be used, comparing with the types and angle of lighting available. We evaluated the contrast of all these components, working out what bits went well together based on the effects and emotions they conveyed.
It was thoroughly challenging and enjoyable, and helped me appreciate the aesthetic values of creation whilst learning the essence of teamwork, extensive planning and hard work, all of which are important for any successful business.
I am very keen to learn the art of robotics, and hope to make a mark in this world in the way of robots that would be helpful in diverse ways; for use in search and rescue for instance, or aiding fire-fighters and excavation teams after disasters. I am very passionate about robotics and it motivates to study this course.
I really hope that by accepting me in your university, it serves as a catalyst to achieving my goal in life as a renowned robot researcher and designer."
"Flirting with electrons has worked wonders. Electronics engineers have manipulated these positron antiparticles to revolutionise fields as diverse as acoustics, medicine and robotics.
Impressed by these phenomenal advancements, I am ambitious to join the wonderful people who relentlessly strive to change our lives for the better.
Electronics engineering is the most viable option to realise my dream of adding to the beauty of life. It is one of the few fields in which a small advancement, such as in fabrication or integration, can make a big difference.
I therefore wish to study electronics engineering with the aim of becoming part of the next revolution. It's not just about revolutionising the world, but following my passion, a love for what I do best, and the benefit it will bring to me as well as to others.
I love to fuse maths with physics in solving problems of varied nature as it provides me the opportunity to use two of my favourite subjects simultaneously. I believe that engineering will provide me lots of opportunities to continue this routine.
Electricity and Magnetism have remained my favourite topics ever since I studied them in the O Levels. My obsession with electronics has even encouraged me to try practical circuitry. These successful attempts at assembling circuits like LDR and Radio receiver have given me valuable insight into electronics and confirmed my aptitude for electronics engineering.
I feel that my academics have prepared me amply for a challenging course ahead. Last year the Governor of my province awarded me a Gold Medal for Excellence in Academics.
I have successfully competed in NPTC (a national physics competition synonymous to BPhO) to rank among the top 50 students of Pakistan and with further short listing due in a few months, I am optimistic of making it to the top five students who will represent Pakistan in the 40th International Physics Olympiad.
The most recent International Kangaroo Mathematics Contest ranked me among the top 50 students of Pakistan.
MIT OpenCourseWare lectures in Physics are the primary source to quench my thirst for in-depth knowledge. I usually follow these lectures with corresponding assignments and IPhO past questions.
I also enjoy browsing HowStuffWorks as it helps me to appreciate the beautiful world from an engineering perspective. “How it's Made” and “I Didn't Know That” are my favourite TV programmes for the same reason.
In my 2008 Internship with CARE Foundation, I volunteered as a Teaching Assistant to grades 9th and 10th in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. It was one of the best experiences of my life as I was teaching and preparing assignments for students just one & two grades junior to me!
I feel honoured to be one of the 431 Supervisors who are managing over 1.3 million users on WikiAnswers, the 38th most visited website on earth. WikiAnswers has given me an opportunity to share my knowledge globally.
Side by side, frequent collaboration with other WikiAnswers contributors, mainly to improve an answer, has given me teamwork skills and introduced me to the beauty of diversity. Performing website supervision in addition to the regular academic work has taught me time management and task prioritisation.
The most appropriate way to realise my dreams is to enter research after completing my studies at the Doctorate level.
Given this career aspiration, it is but natural that I select a university which is at the forefront of research and where students are encouraged to join their professors for hands-on experience.
I have chosen your university because of its focus on research and the opportunity it provides to participate within a diverse student body.
Although I am applying as an international student, my indefinite leave to remain in the UK is due in three years time and this is why UK is my primary choice for higher education."
"My determination is to study engineering relating to my desire and previous studies to seek the challenge of today's competitive world.
There seems to be a huge target to lead the world in technology because now a day there are a lot of professionals in the world and defeat them is second challenge. This is what I am interested in.
As my matriculation progressed, my interest in mathematics and particularly physics developed. Studying physics at advanced level allows me to think about how things move and react to forces and how these forces can be used in solving both theoretical and practical problems.
As I passed my intermediate examination, I was very much interested in controlled devices like robots, Computer Numerically controlled machines, mobile and specially computer. For saving time I started a short course of mobile repairing. From which I learned a lot and got practical experience.
After that I came to know about the HND Mechatronics, which increase my interest in engineering. I got admission to a HND in Mechatronics in August 2006. The study on Mechatronics allowed me to solve unfamiliar problems during practical work using familiar concepts.
After the completion of 1st year of HND I learned a power tool of engineering designs Pro E in WAHID INDUSTRIES GUJRAT. As I was trusted member of class so as a team leader I selected a project of a packing machine and its controlled system during the final semester of HND.
I designed the controlled system that sends the error to user's mobile using GSM system of local mobile community. Although I enjoyed the challenge that my college project has given me.
During examination of final semester of HND, P&G Pakistan hired me as a Plant Operation Leader. Fabrics Home Care (F&HC) department is new department in P&G Pakistan.
Here I worked as a Plant Technician in Start UP team of Product Supply Chain. P&G gave me opportunity of training of operation and maintenance in Egypt for six months.
It was a new thing for me to be a part of such huge organization. I worked very hard to achieve my goals and completed my assignment 15 days before target.
During my on the job training I have been a part of Integrated Work System (IWS). I finished my training in the end of February 2009. This informative technical experience offered a unique chance to understand and to observe different areas of engineering which subsequently led me to the decision to peruse mechanical engineering.
I believe that success as an engineer in modern society requires a combination of management, communication and business skills.
Therefore with my previous experience, focused attitude and will for success, I have the ability and motivation to meet the demands of studying at degree's level."
"My mother always said, ""You always enjoyed the company of tools from your father's tool kit, may be passion for trying against odd runs in your blood.""
My father is an Electrical engineer by qualification with laurels and industrial consultant by profession, only after hard earned experience in all walks of industrial environment. As long as I can remember, whenever I went along him to his sites, I always wandered around and tried to get inside the working of equipments, I stumbled with.
My father always told me that electronics is changing almost everything from methods to equipment. Soon enough I understood what he meant, as I began to see and imagine the impact of electronics and especially Telecommunication Engineering, in my education to entertainment and leisure. Finally, Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering gave me the career to which I can dedicate my vigor and endeavor.
After securing a meritorious position in senior secondary exam, my parents advised me to opt for a Diploma in Electronics and Telecommunication. This was quite unconventional according to Indian education system. Many thought I had taken up a course that would never give me a successful career.
I, on the contrary felt multifarious effect in my studies, career and life because it had given me a perfect track to my destiny and taken away all worries and given me all the time in the world to achieve my goal of life.
While this diploma helped me to understand engineering studies with much better prospective, it also served as a platform to understand many practical aspects of telecommunication engineering. It was during this time that I had my first encounter with system design and implementation.
Due to interest in field and ability to perform time and again I completed my Diploma with distinction and received best student award along with a sum of about 100$ and a Gold medal.
In 2000 I started my engineering studies from Electronics Department of S.R.K.N. Engineering College. Overwhelming confidence and leadership qualities soon made me a distinctive student. I was given a chance to setup laboratories and project works with faculties on various occasions of high academic value. I was appreciated as a technically equipped student in my department.
Although active participation in extra-curricular activities like dramatics during cultural events and working as an organiser of events like technical symposium for college did not let anybody put a tag of bookworm on me. While I enjoyed playing football for my departmental team, working out project ideas was still my passion.
During this time I made projects for fun and leisure, electronic voting machine for our departmental elections, fastest finger first systems for quiz competitions in college gathering etc. These projects only served to aggravate my thirst for electronic system design.
With the completion of my Bachelor course, I decided to go for a post graduate degree in Electronics engineering. Successfully clearing the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) exam with 98.02 percentile marks helped me in receiving a scholarship of about 2500$; sponsored by Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry of Indian Government; for my post graduation studies. Assiduous goal orientation kept me focused on to the goal of implementing novel ideas that boggled me while making projects in the master's course.
In one of such event, while listening to an expert lecture of Dr. Young Beom Cho of Konkuk University, Seoul, I perceived a notion about some lesser known facts about error control coding theory in communication systems. Dr. Cho mentioned about Low Density Parity Check Codes which were destined to change the face of wireless communication.
He also stated the challenges currently encountered by researchers. It was interesting noting that, with proven superiority over any other system known till date, LDPC codes were practically ignored for past 30 years. Of lately a major work is being proposed and being done in this area. These facts about LDPC almost immediately engrossed me with eagerness to work out something interesting if not novel.
Taking the task as a challenge I drew my path of motion. ""Don't pray for lighter burden, but pray for stronger backs"". Though tumbling on some occasions, my hard work paid off. My work on LDPC was widely appreciated.
Encouraged by many authoritarians working in the field of VLSI design, and Error Control Coding, I wrote some technical papers that were published in various National Journals. It is this ground work and encouragement that tempts me to proceed further in the direction of carrying out my PhD in the field of LDPC codes.
I plan to carry out my Ph. D. in the field of Low Density Parity Check Codes. I would particularly work on developing new algorithms which will make LDPC practically implementable. This will be instrumental in making systems for next generation wireless communication technology and 4th generation mobile application.
Exploring the mathematics involved I will try to find out new possibilities of hardware implementation. In this process, an international doctorate will groom me intellectually, embellish my knowledge, bring prosperity in terms of wealth of knowledge and would make me a ladder of success for others to climb contributing to evolution of my country and human society as a whole."
"Throughout my 5th and 6th years at Nairn academy my interest in maths and physics has developed greatly. I thoroughly enjoyed these 2 higher subjects and I am now studying both at advanced higher. In particular, the Mechanics topic of the physics has grabbed my attention and I scored top of my class in our last test with 95%.
These subjects have always fascinated me as I use my problem solving skills to their best. I have attained the maths and physics awards for every year at academy. I also studied chemistry at higher level, which increased my knowledge and understanding of the world around us.
I would love to continue my study of the world's mechanics into higher education where I would have much more difficult and intricate studies, both theoretical and practical.
I have put much effort and time into researching university courses and university life and have attended several open days. Just a few days ago my physics class was taken on a school trip to Aberdeen University where we attended a couple of lectures and a couple of practical experiments studying wave-particle duality.
Also 6th year at academy has given me a taster of university life as in attending a class where I take down notes then learning the topic and completing questions in my own time. I have also been doing my best to complete all homework on time and to the highest possible standard in all my subjects.
Using my mathematical skill, I have been able to work with my father on statistical analysis assignments over the past few years.
My father is a mathematics teacher and works on survey breakdown in his spare time. This involves data input from questionnaires into a computer spreadsheet (usually Microsoft Excel) and then breaking the results down into percentages, averages, graphs and any other results needed.
Then the results are all joined together into one report. This gave me a chance to use skills I learned in school to complete a real life task and also to earn money.
Music plays an important role in my life and I spend a lot of time listening, playing and writing it. I have been playing guitar for 6 years and I am currently studying for an SQA performing unit in guitar at advanced higher level. I play a very wide range of genres like Jazz, Blues, Metal, Rock, Acoustic, and Flamenco.
I have recently become a big fan of progressive music where it is all very complexly written with many time signature changes, tempo changes and odd scales. I enjoy the intricacy of the song writing and the effort required to learn or write these kinds of songs.
I play in 2 metal bands at the moment both on lead guitar. I am the main songwriter in each of the bands and I am very dedicated to practicing and making each band as tight as possible. I spend a lot of time trying to promote the highland music scene by organising and advertising local concerts.
Using basic electronic skills I learn in physics I have been able to repair my electric guitar and amp on multiple occasions, which again has encouraged my learning by its practical uses. I also have been playing the euphonium for 5 years and play in the school brass band.
Walking is another of my interests and I am often up on hill walks around the Scottish Munroes. About 4 times a week I will walk to or from my home village of Auldearn to school in Nairn, which is about 4.5miles.
To study at university level offers great opportunities for me, in career and enjoyment, and I am sure that I have the skill and dedication to succeed."
"I could still remember how excited I felt when I first saw the phone in my home, when I first used a beeper, and when I first used a mobile phone.
I am impressed about the huge change in my own life brought by the rapid development of the field of E.E. At present, I would like to pursue my Master degree of Telecommunications Engineering in the University of Melbourne as my commencements of life.
After accomplishing high school with brilliant record, I fought my way out of millions of candidates into XX University, one of the best universities in China. I studied at Communications Department, a highly selective department with a gathering of smart students who are hard to compete with.
During my four-year undergraduate study, although I was not the best student in the college from my GPA, I took every course seriously, and I tried to make good use of every chance to deepen my knowledge and sharpen my academic ability. Practical skills are as important as theoretical studies for the E.E students, so I put great emphasis upon laboratory experiments.
From the basic physics experiment to the major specialised experiment, such as emerging switching technology and computer network technology.
I did everything carefully, from preparation to the analysis of final results. In my junior, I won a chance to take part in a course design with other 20 students who were selected strictly from 334 students, working with Prof. XX, a celebrated professor in wireless communication field in XX University, in his study of Microcontroller and wireless communication theory for 4 months. I taught myself Assembly Language and the Principle of Microcontroller, and achieved the communications between serial interfaces.
Based on those academic experiences with Prof. XX, I got a privilege when asking him to be my thesis supervisor. The two main topics about my thesis are “Channel Adaptive coding” and “HARQ”.
By simulation with MATLAB, I compared the throughout of the communications system, adapting HARQ and ARQ in two kinds of channels using the same channel coding method respectively. I studied more than20 foreign references, more than 10 books and other references, and gained deeper understanding of the key technologies used in the emerging Telecommunications industry.
After I graduated, I took a job as software testing in a XX to gain more knowledge in software. During the 5 months, I learned the basic software testing theory, design the testing methods and analyzed the testing steps to find out the problems. Then I took the responsibility to do BT testing, studied and analysed the different kinds of BT protocols to design the testing steps.
These research-related and practical experiences enable me to have the opportunity to work with many excellent scholars and was able to deal with instruments like ARM, Microcontroller, DSP and MATLAB, and also helped me to gain greater insight into the basic methods of timer control and interruption programming, so that is a training of my ability of learning, designing and developing software and hardware I believe that my analytical ability and logical thinking get greatly improved through these experiences.
The feeling of being challenged by some difficulties and then beating them flat gave me the best gratification and self-confidence I have never enjoyed so much.
Apart from my academic life, I have taken an active part in extracurricular activities. Being the Vice Chairman of the Volunteer Union is the most fruitful experience. I organized to raise funds for the children whose family cannot afford their schooling, which was supported and rated with thousands of students.
I also won the chance to be a volunteer for the 6th Asian Winter Games and was awarded the Excellent Volunteer. These volunteer experiences brought the profound meaning of giving. I always believe that study is the most important thing for a college student, but it is not everything.
Learning to help and care about vulnerable groups, cultivating the sense of responsibility and the spirit of dedication is also a compulsory course for the college students.
My ultimate goal is to be a leading scholar or a prestigious Engineer to make a real contribution to the Telecommunications field. As a saying goes: Learning will never end.
Based on my enthusiasm in Telecommunications and the desire to study the protocols and even develop the new protocols, I believe the further study; especially the abroad study experience will not only sharpen my professional knowledge of cutting-edge knowledge of TE, but also broaden my horizons by working with the international team.
My academic background and research experience may not be the best among the applicants, but I believe the spirit of fortitude and enthusiasm will help me to stand out, and the commitment of quick movement will help me to keep my words.
I will try my best to achieve my goal in academic and make contributions to your faculty. Give me a chance and I will not let you down!"
"I have always been reassured by the logic and certainty associated with maths and the investigative approach of the sciences and appreciate the advantage of combining these to practical effect.
For instance, work on Mechanics modules has introduced problems that require a creative mind, whilst considering real and useful applications.
A course in engineering that will further challenge me in this way as well as applying scientific theory to practical situations appears to be the ideal step forward.
Within academia, I successfully completed my A2 Mathematics in Year 12, achieving Grade A, and now welcome the challenge of Further Mathematics: a course that will be fully complementary to my interest in pursuing a degree in engineering. Additionally, this year, I began studying AS Economics and Business Studies.
The choice of this course was prompted by a belief that it is important for my understanding of the business world and very much fuelled by interest in recent world affairs.
After the summer examinations I was pleased with my A2 Mathematics and AS marks, particularly my Physics result which I am advised is one of the Top 10 in the country. I also hope to subsequently further my interest in languages following good results at GCSE in French and German.
The subjects I have followed to A2 level are all useful within engineering. In Mathematics I have learnt the necessary methods to cope with a variety of situations whilst in Physics I have gained understanding of the basic principles behind them. Chemistry gives an insight into materials choice. My enjoyment of these subjects derives from, not only knowing the techniques and methods needed, but also the background thinking and proofs behind them.
Historical knowledge of economic changes from private reading, and my observations on the development and decline of the textile industry in the North-West, have resulted in a specific interest in industrial progress and a greater grasp of the basic engineering aspects involved therein.
I subscribe to New Scientist and enjoy reading about the recent advances in technology and in the development of theories of the universe. From a practical standpoint I have helped with the maintenance of an MGB in the family garage and have learnt a great deal about the plethora of materials involved in construction from the ubiquitous evidence of house renovation activity since a move 15 months ago.
Whilst maintaining a high academic standard, my self-organization has enabled me to participate in different activities and groups including a local brass band and the Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award, now completed.
Involvement in various sports, including hockey and 1st XV rugby, has allowed me to learn to work more effectively in a team environment, encouraging me to trust others and offer support to colleagues. I have also taken part in open days and school house activities such as music and sport and hope to become more involved in the organisation of such events this year.
Aside from the obvious benefits from team working I am, also, very clear of the constant need to determine my own direction and do value my ability to complete targets on time, in full. I also believe I listen to constructive criticism and act upon it. I work hard and feel I am organized and happy to be responsible for my own future."
"I personally feel that there is substantial cachet to be gained by pursuing the field of mechanical engineering. The diversity present in this field has attracted me and it is consistent with my enthusiasm for Mathematics and Science.
It has a lot of scope as well. I have gone through the entire gist of the course and the specific areas which interested me were Mechatronics, Robotics and Project Design.
I know what a career in engineering is like, since I come from a third generation family of engineers. I have been quite impressed by the teamwork involved in mechanical engineering; how people work in groups, in order to complete a project e.g. produce a machine which would curtail the load on laborers and would generate results more quickly and efficiently.
In my opinion, supervising, problem solving and decision making play an important role in most of the engineering firms. Studying Accounting till AS level has helped me to further add to these skills. A level Physics and Chemistry, through finely planned syllabi, have provided me a beneficial educational experience.
They have equipped me with adequate knowledge and understanding so that I could become a confident member of the advanced world of technology. I have the zeal to develop self inspiration and the talent to work in a consistent manner. I believe that Science and Mathematics are cohesive.
By studying Mathematics, I have gained the skills which help me solve real life problems and such skills, more importantly, have been useful in the Science subjects as well. I analyze everything in depth and once I have spotted my goal, I keep on aiming for it until I succeed.
Due to my interest in these subjects and some others, I scored excellent grades in O levels and as a result, I got 100% scholarship for my entire AS and A level course.
At school, I have participated in many extracurricular activities. I am a member of numerous clubs and societies, which include Science, Journalism, Music and Community Service. I am the head of the Mathematics society and my task is to design quizzes.
I have a keen interest in photography and as a member of the journalism society, I have the responsibility for taking pictures at various school events. Because of the charisma I possess, I was selected as the house leader of the school.
Last year I received the Duke of Edinburgh Gold award for 4 activities i.e. social service at Darul-Sakun (home for special children), outstanding performances in soccer, creative writing (English) and for completing a project by working with the Agha Khan University Library as a volunteer.
I am currently doing community service at S.I.U.T (Sind Institute of Urology and Transplant). I have also played cricket for the school team. In my free time, I go out for swimming, bowling and sometimes fishing, or I get involved in indoor activities such as chess or modeling kits, constructing plastic airplane models, in particular.
The reason I have chosen England for higher education is that I am aware of the environment and the fact that quality education is found there. Besides that, I will not have communication problems because my English Language skills are of the required standard.
I have relished my school life and now I hope to be warmly welcomed by the more challenging, independent and competitive university lifestyle.
Once I enter professional life, I would go the extra mile and will try to come out with a cutting edge over others working in the same capacity as mine. These small achievements in the ultimate analysis would give a new impetus to the corporation where I will work by galvanizing it."
"To me, engineering is fascinating. From what I learnt, the word “engineer” literally means “to make things happen”, the simple things in our daily lives to the complicated systems in factories.
Engineering plays a big role in the modern world of technology; this is what I am interested in.
Since young, I love to deal with numbers hence mathematics have always been my best subjects. I am currently taking Cambridge A-Levels, further mathematics is my favorite among the five subjects as it is challenging and much more interesting as compared to the normal Mathematics lessons.
I also find both Chemistry and Physics lesson much enjoyable as I am able to apply scientific theories to everyday life situations.
Throughout my academic years, I had been an active participant in my extracurricular activities. I have great leadership qualities, leading, conducting clubs and societies, and organizing events and competitions. I held the post of assistant secretary of Chinese Language Society (CLS) and was promoted to secretary in year 2007.
I had been involved in performances, both on stage and back stage, in conjunction with Chinese New Year, organised by CLS. I was a committee member in organizing events for the visiting Australian students. My team and I organized the Friendship Project in conjunction with the International Friendship Month on February. I also participated in Leadership Training Camp organized by PHC.
With guidance and encouragement from teachers and friends, I represented my school in several competitions. I was the producer of a drama, and I led my team to compete at school level in year 2005. I won the first runner up for the Chinese Poem Declamation Competition in year 2005.
In year 2006, together with my team, I won the 3rd place in the Education and Career Exploration at district level. My team also won 1st place for the folio presentation. All this experiences improved my understanding and skills in team working, time management, communication skills, as well as folio, visual and oral presentation.
In year 2008, I was chosen to participate in Malaysia National Service Training Camp. I lived there for three months, far away from home. In time, I gained lots of friends. I was exposed to different cultures of all ethnic groups and had to undergo hardcore physical trainings, fun character building classes, and also went for community services.
Besides gaining muscles and fitness, I gained new friends from all over my country, learnt to be independent, and skills I never learnt in school, such as surviving skills in the wild. It was fun, exciting and memorable.
Why do I choose engineering? It is a well recognised profession and provides career opportunities world wide. The chance to see how things work fascinates me and furthermore, as mechanical engineering is a wide field, I will have wide job opportunities.
Whether to work as a professional engineer which will be a technical route or to work in management level as my career progresses. I believe my determination to be an engineer will be the willpower for me to excel at higher education. I hope my application will be successful, as I know I have the potential to excel at higher education."
"As a child, driven by an unnatural curiosity, I was often damaging some electronic devices by knocking them down and failing to reassemble just for finding out what they contained or how they worked.
I have developed this habit later on computers with the difference that I did not caused any major damage to any.
My parents brought me my first computer when I was 9. At that time, only few persons knew how to use it and no one had time to teach me, so I had to learn by my own.
As I was discovering more about software programs and hardware devices from books, IT magazines, articles, forums and practical research, my interest in them was increasing and computers have soon become one of my passions.
In order to know more about it, I was working during my summer holiday in one of my friends' computer store, where I was installing the software on computers.
Next to computers, I like mathematics, which represents a way to relax me, to raise my morale when I am wretched or sad; solving or discussing about a difficult problem has always made me feel good.
At school, it has been my favorite subject, at which I have excelled not only by taking great marks but by obtaining prizes and mentions in national, county and local competitions and Olympiads, such as a bronze medal at the National Mathematics Olympiad in 9th grade, first prize at the County Mathematics Olympiad in the 9th, 11th and 12th and several other prizes and award in national contests.
My achievements are the results of a perpetuate preparation acquired with the help of the teachers from my school and from the program for Gifted Youth ""Centru de excelenta"", which I attended in the last five years.
The love of mathematics and computers was the main factor that influenced my career decision, to work in the technology industry, which has become one the most important industries, being vital for modern economy and other fields as well as a part of every person's life.
This decision determined my university course choice as one related to computer science, which will help me to acquire the education, skills and experience that my career requires.
My preparation for career began in high school, where I have studied Mathematics and Informatics.
As a student, I focused on my profile subjects: mathematics, physics and computer science, which made me to distinguish in my classroom and in competitions, by winning prizes and awards such as the ones won at mathematical contests, a Honorable Mention at International Phi Contest at physics and a second and a third prize won at the national phase of the same contest, though I have not neglected the other ones, receiving high marks at most of them.
In the mean time I have participated to an ecological program, initiated by my biology teacher, intended to decrease the environment pollution by presenting its effects.
As hobbies, I like to watch classical movies and to read about it and about actors, to read literature, history, nutrition and psychology, to solve puzzles and brain teasers, to play tennis and basketball, to swim, to listen to music, to drive, to discover new things about different cultures, to travel and to hang out.
I have always dreamed to study in UK because I admire people's mentality and nature, the education given to students, the living standards and I am fascinated by its history and its language.
It would represent a great opportunity for me to discover new a culture and mentality and to live in a multicultural environment. I wish my qualities, skills and achievements make me a good candidate for your university and help me fulfill my dream, by attending a Computer Science course."
"Almost any technology we take for granted today involves engineering: from mobile phones to space shuttles, engineering certainly has an impact on our daily lives.
Increasingly over the last few years, I have become drawn to engineering and the wide range of possibilities that studying in this field can offer.
Modern technology always intrigues me and I find it fascinating to see how they function, especially with the intricate physics behind them. I believe that although it is important to determine how things work, it is perhaps more valuable to understand why they fail and use it to our advantage to construct better solutions.
I aspire to become an engineer because I believe that I can make a difference to our lives, by creating solutions for the many problems that surround our world today.
After embracing a larger interest in engineering, I decided to broaden my mind by reading about different engineers such as James Watt and Edison. They both inspired me as they dedicated their work to improve living standards at the time, which revolutionised the way we lived.
In July I attended a Headstart course at Loughborough to discover more about this field in general, and it has further secured my opinion that I want to be part of this area of expertise. Working at Steve Leung's Architects in Hong Kong last summer has provided me with a sound opportunity to gain an incredible insight into the areas of architecture and structural engineering.
Although it was hard work, I enjoyed the challenges by solving them with scientific and mathematical ideas. Besides, I learnt to use statistical models to solve complex calculations, whilst developing teamwork and time management skills.
I believe that I am well suited to this field, as my subjects and thinking reflect the nature of engineering. Studying physics with the Advanced Extension Award has provided me with the core scientific knowledge needed. My innate logical thought enables me to apply this theory to diverse and practical problems, which I find challenging and enjoyable.
Maths has given me numerous problem solving opportunities and allows me to apply usual concepts to solve unusual situations. Furthermore, by studying Design and Technology, I gained experiences with electronics, materials and CAD/CAM, as well as coping with large amounts of coursework. Alongside the main subjects, I am also undertaking Chinese as an extra language. In addition, Geography at AS level presents me with analytical abilities and a greater awareness of issues on a larger scale.
For the past 4 years I have thoroughly enjoyed boarding, as I get on well with others easily. This has helped me to develop as a person, making me independent and organized, but more importantly it has developed my interpersonal skills. As I am from a family of Chinese origins in the UK, I am able to speak both English and Chinese fluently, which is an invaluable advantage for me. Apart from my curricular activities, I like to be involved with other aspects of school life, such as sports.
My favourites are rugby and hockey, and I am currently a member of the 1st Hockey team. I also help to coach the U15s team occasionally, and this develops my teamwork skills and discipline.
I have also enjoyed taking part and helping to coordinate “Jack and the Beanstalk”, which is the school pantomime for this year. Whenever possible, I enjoy socializing with friends, as I believe there is more to life than just academic success.
Through my experiences I am beginning to appreciate the future and prosperity that engineering has to offer. I hope that a degree from your university will act as a key for a successful career in engineering."
"Knowledge, creativity, skills and experience: these are essential qualities needed to excel in the field of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, hence my desire to develop them to the highest possible level.
My interest in this course arose from the love I have for electricity as regards its transmission over long distances and its conversion into various forms of energy.
I have been able to pursue my interest in the course by reading different articles and journals from which I learnt that Electrical Engineering deals with the problems associated with large-scale electrical systems such as power transmission while Electronic engineering focuses on the study of small-scale electronic systems including computers and integrated circuits.
A level Mathematics and Physics have helped me to develop my analytic and problem solving skills; A2 Calculus and Complex numbers exposed me to a new dimension of greater possibilities, Environment Physics introduced me to efficient and economics means of power generation while Environmental Chemistry helped me to realise the need for pollution control during the generation, transmission and consumption of electricity.
Judging by the excellent track record I have in these subjects which earned me excellent grades, Government scholarship and academic laurels, coupled with the joy and fulfilment I derive from studying them, I became convinced beyond reasonable doubts that this is the right course for me.
My desire to study in the UK is based on the fact that it is reputed for a very high standard of education, prestigious universities and a peaceful and hospitable environment which is conducive to learning and research and also welcoming to international students.
The official language in my country, Nigeria is English; consequently, all my lectures and assessments have always been in English.
I have been able to enhance my communication skills in English by actively participating in group discussions, class presentations, and other social activities, and this is evident from my achievement of a B2 grade in English language in my WASSCE. I also attended a Citizenship and Leadership training course in which I obtained an A grade based on my outstanding leadership and communication skills.
I opted for a gap year because I am under aged and this I am spending wisely by enhancing my computing skills in the use of various Electronics and Mathematics simulation software such as Matlab, Multisim, C++ and computer aided design.
I also pay periodic visits to a local university where I attend Engineering seminars, career talks, and also get the opportunity to interact with students and lecturers in this field.
My hobbies include watching movies and documentaries; I participate in religious activities for a length of three hours every Sunday and also partake in various exercises and sporting activities such as table tennis for about an hour daily.
I wish to work towards my Master's and Doctorate Degrees immediately upon completion of my undergraduate degree and also look forward to becoming an active member of a professional organisation such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) so as to ensure a continual update of my knowledge of the ever advancing field of Electrical and Electronics Engineering."
"If I were to describe myself in one word, it would definitely be inquisitive. Since young, I have always been eager to know how things work and what the principles that lie within them are. Hence I have always enjoyed science-related subjects particularly Mathematics and Physics.
A glimpse of engineering subject offered in my primary school further exposed me to the knowledge of the operation of simple machinery and this has undoubtedly inspired me to cultivate skills and understanding in this area.
An occasional working opportunity at my uncle’s garage at age of 15 has given me hands-on exposure on car engines. I was impressed with the design and mechanical operation of car engines where it incorporated four valves per cylinder to allow more input of vaporised fuel mixture to generate more power.
This motivated me to pursue my uncle and his fellow workers for more information on the engine systems and thus developed my passion in engine design. Since then, I have established my ambition to become a mechanical engineer.
In order to broaden my knowledge in this area of expertise, I have done a lot of reading related to the field including ""Invention by Design: How Engineers Get from Thought to Thing"" and “Mechanical Engineering Design”.
I found the latter more interesting as it discussed the designs of various mechanical elements such as shafts, fasteners, springs, ball bearings, gears, belts, chains, and wire ropes. Besides, I have also read articles on few famous engineers, and of all, the one that inspires me the most is George Stephenson, the ‘Father of Railways’. I admire him for his contribution and also his noble value of striving for improvements.
However, I strongly believe that experience is the best teacher. So, I started engaging myself in related jobs after graduating from high school. Working as a part-time technician in a local fabrication company, named Hit-Tech, has allowed me to deal with lathes and drillers.
The experience was challenging but rewarding as I was able to work first-hand with mechanical engineers and learned to interpret engineering drawings. In addition, I also had an internship with IT Portlink, a trading company that supplies various port equipment including quay cranes, straddle carriers and RTGs. I was based on the assembling site located at Northport, Malaysia where I was assigned to work in maintenance and repair services of the equipment.
It was really an eye-opening experience which I would never get to learn through reading and this has escalated my desire to be a mechanical engineer.
I am aware that an excellent leadership and strong interpersonal skills are essential for an engineer to navigate big, complex projects in a company and leading teams to drive innovation. Thus I involved myself in AIESEC, the world’s largest youth-run organization, in order to build my confidence and leadership. AIESEC has given me the opportunity to meet many individuals of various working backgrounds.
I am deeply inspired by their speeches of success during the conference and this has driven me to push myself to a higher level. In addition, participating in the AIESEC’s Local Leadership Development Camp (LLDS) has trained me to be more proactive and enabled me to express my thoughts more openly in public.
In college, I was also a member of the activities department of ALSCO, the A-levels students’ council. This has further improved my communication skills and teamwork. Meanwhile, I enjoy jogging and playing badminton during my spare time. I believe the balance of sports and studies is vital for general fitness.
I see myself as a committed and determined candidate to excel in mechanical engineering. I foresee myself contributing to the development of innovative machineries and designs in years to come. Thus I sincerely hope to be given an opportunity to further my studies with in this field where I strongly believe it will mark the beginning of my milestone to success in this area of expertise."
"The subjects of maths and physics have always fascinated me and I knew very early on that I wanted to pursue a career that involves science. As I progressed through school I found that I was much more interested in the application of the theory rather than the theory itself, and this is why I would like to study electronic engineering.
I enjoy physics particularity as it can be observed in every aspect of life. From apples falling from trees to lightning, physics explains how the world works, and engineers throughout history have used their knowledge of physics to overcome problems that they face. The Romans built aqueducts to supply their cities with water; William Thomson helped lay the transatlantic telegraph cables that made communication between Europe and the Americas viable.
I also studied Advanced Higher Music last year at school. I am very interested in the use of electronics in music, and I wrote a project on the physics of the electric guitar. This interest prompted me to spend a week of work experience at Wolfson Microelectronics, a local company that engineer integrated circuits for many high profile audio equipment firms.
During my stay I was assigned the task of designing and assembling a circuit to investigate the voltage offset and noise created by an operational amplifier.
I was also introduced to a silicon microphone, a development which is sure to be significant in the future of electronics, and introduced to all the main stages in the development of a microchip, from design to failure analysis. My forthcoming Advanced Higher Physics investigation will be concerned with the properties of op-amps, the variables that affect these properties, and their applications.
In June, I attended a week-long Headstart course held at the University of Cambridge. We were given a task to assemble and programme a robot to navigate a course, using both dead-reckoning and sensors; I was part of the winning team. The course was thoroughly enjoyable and confirmed that engineering was the subject for me.
I have applied to spend my gap year working in the engineering industry, through the Year in Industry scheme. I hope that I will gain invaluable experience of the industry in which I would like to build my career in, and this will no doubt help me understand better how what I learn at university relates to real-world applications.
I play the violin, guitar and bagpipes all to a high standard. I am a first violin in the main school orchestra and the chamber orchestra, lead guitar in the school ""Rhythm and Blues"" band and a senior member of the pipe band. I hold the rank of Corporal in my school cadet force, and I am a young leader at my Scout troop.
Balancing these numerous extra-curricular activities with my academic work has forced me to develop my time management skills. My involvement in both cadets and Scouts has also greatly added to my team working and leadership skills.
I was the leader of the team that won the Edinburgh Area Scout camping competition in 2005, and we finished in the top 5 in the country. Currently, I am working towards both my Duke of Edinburgh Gold award and my Queen's Scout award.
I also have a keen interest in computers, assembling my first at the age of twelve, and I am currently teaching myself Mandarin Chinese, something that I would like to continue studying throughout university and a skill that I believe will be very useful in the future, especially in the electronics industry. I keep up to date with the latest scientific news in by reading both Physics Review and New Scientist.
I believe that studying electronic engineering is the best way for me to apply my accumulated knowledge of maths and physics and I look forward to a career that will constantly present me with new challenges."
"I am predicted to get 3 A grades in Physics, Mathematics and Further Mathematics. Since I first grasped the principles of maths, I have been fascinated by the subject. This interest has led to me being placed in the advanced maths and science groups at school.
I find understanding the way things work intriguing because of the incredible variety of tasks different machines are capable of performing and I would like the opportunity to expand my knowledge at university. The course I have chosen will allow me to study a range of disciplines initially, with the ability to specialise in the final years.
At the age of 15, I spent several weeks at a local engineering company as part of my work experience. This gave me an insight into CAD, mechanical engineering and computer systems, which has led to me wanting to study these at university.
I have participated in several UK Maths Challenge events, achieving a silver award twice. In 2003 I received the Culford School award for IT and whilst at the school I was also on the main editorial team for the school's magazine 'Th'Inkwell'.
This role gave me experience in working to deadlines as well as improving my teamwork skills. Whilst at Culford I was appointed to the position of IT assistant. The position involved tasks such as helping with the basic running of the network and helping others to use the software.
I have been appointed to several positions of responsibility throughout my school life, most recently helping younger children in my school with reading disabilities and Sixth Form Prefect (I was also a prefect at Culford School). I also have a regular part-time job at a local restaurant and through working there I have learned the importance of punctuality and reliability at work.
In the summer of 2007 I participated in a World Challenge Expedition to India. During the expedition, I spent a month participating in community work at a school, where we taught English lessons, painted a classroom and purchased desks and musical instruments.
However, it wasn't all glamorous as we also rebuilt their toilet block! After helping in the school we went trekking in the Himalayas. I am particularly proud of the fact that the GBP 4000 cost of this was paid for entirely by my part-time job, without any financial help from my family. Overall this experience was valuable because it required me to take responsibility and make decisions on behalf of myself and the team.
I have several hobbies, which I enjoy outside of school. One of these is a keen interest in photography; one of my photographs was featured on the main page of an arts website.
Another of my passions is music. During my time at Culford I passed my grade 3 trombone exam and was placed first in the school music competition.
I enjoy socialising with new people and taking part in events as a team. For this reason I was a member of the Air Training Corps for two years, where I was able to participate in activities such as flying and aerobatics. Currently I am secretary of the Environment Committee at my 6th form.
We are attempting to reduce the carbon footprint of our school and create an eco-friendly ethos within the school. Some examples of our initiatives are organising a student car-pool and switching off unnecessary electrical appliances.
My experiences during my AS-A level studies have enabled me to be self-reliant, organised and highly motivated, which should prove to be invaluable tools for life at university and later life."
"It is exciting to discover the fundamental properties of the world that we are living in, and to reveal the internal structure of the appliances that we are using everyday. Being interested in the fundamental nature of matter, I enjoy viewing things from its smallest units, and hence to develop a complete picture of those things.
I began to study science when I was in primary school. I found Physics and Chemistry particularly interesting, because they were mostly related to the fundamentals of this world. Physics especially amazed me, since it summarises the world and the complicated phenomena by simple and comprehensive equations and formulae.
While I was studying at primary school in Hong Kong (I came to the UK about one year ago), my enthusiasm for science and technology started to grow. I tried to open a scientific calculator with a screwdriver, and looked at the structure inside.
I had no idea about how the whole system worked of course, but I was fascinated by how the graphite-like substance on the little piece of transparent plastic did the difficult calculations in an instant.
After I entered secondary school, I managed to open and examine electronic devices such as TV game consoles and my friends' mobile phones, with their permissions, of course, and I could roughly work out the mechanism of the systems.
To be able to study science subjects and complete coursework at university, logical problem solving techniques and good data managing skills are crucial. I like playing story-based TV games with a large portion of puzzle-solving elements, and they in fact influence my logical mind significantly.
This is indeed the most efficient way to develop my problem solving skills, as I find it satisfying when the method for entering a new stage is deduced after collecting separate pieces of necessary information. On the other hand, the story part of the games inspires my creativity as well.
In addition, I enjoy doing IQ tests found on the internet, which enable me to improve my speed of thinking. Also, I did a Pascal programming course from form3 to form5 at secondary school in Hong Kong, and this gave me the sense of how to solve computer problems.
In 2005, after I came to the UK, I received a Silver Certificate and the Certificate for Best in School from the UK Senior Mathematical Challenge. The school had allowed us only one hour to finish the paper (it was supposed to be a 1.5-hour long paper).
Being a member of the orchestra in my secondary school in Hong Kong, I realised the importance of teamwork. A community can be formed only when the members are doing their job and co-operating well. When I was in form 3, I was chosen by other members to be the manager of the music scores, and a year later, I became the treasurer of the band.
My work involved using a word processor and spreadsheet, which gave me the ability to manage a rather large amount of data.
I love studying new technologies, because inventions improve the world. Technologies involving microscopic views and electronic elements are increasingly popular nowadays, and their diversity of use will become even more important in the future.
I wish I could have the ability to improve the world. Therefore, I am looking forward to studying subjects of this kind at university, rather than treating it only as a hobby."
"Like all young children, I often asked the question “What's that?” However where I apparently differed from others, was in my inquisitiveness to probe further. “How does it work?” being a common phrase of mine and thus, although I didn't realise it, my fascination with engineering was born.
Engineering has had a profound effect on the way we live and in shaping the world we know today. I am intrigued by all aspects of the subject ranging from the utilisation of scientific knowledge to solve practical problems, through to political, environmental and economic considerations.
Maths and Physics at A-level have been challenging, stimulating and exceedingly enjoyable. Not only did I select these subjects in order to pursue engineering at degree level but also because they continue to be my strongest. My curiosity in the operation, design and dynamics of objects, naturally influences my choice of degree, leading me towards Mechanical Engineering.
In 2005 I was fortunate to secure two invaluable weeks of work experience with “Arup”, working on the King's Cross St. Pancras redevelopment and CTRL which was most interesting due to its multidisciplinary nature.
This enabled me to experience a range of disciplines such as Electrical, Civil and Mechanical Engineering, while strengthening my teamwork, organisational and ICT skills. Studying A-level physics also enabled me to visit a local waste plant where turbines converted thermal energy into electricity and see first hand the benefits of Mechanical Engineering to the community as a whole.
Throughout my education I have participated in a range of initiatives and activities, along with assuming many positions of responsibility, such as form representative, house captain, college representative on the school council and coaching the school hockey team.
Communicating with people of various ages and enabling them to further their skills or their ideas is extremely rewarding and provides a real sense of achievement. This has encouraged me to widen my involvement and I now act as a peer mentor and provide classroom support in maths lessons.
In addition, as a member of my school's gifted and talented group, I participated in a residential weekend and many one-day activities where I enhanced my analytical skills. These initiatives have helped me to develop into an imaginative, caring and involved individual. I have also represented my school in a variety of sports such as Football, Athletics and Hockey.
Furthermore I played for my Hockey club, men's 1st XI and Captained the U18 team last season, along with representing Essex for the last 5 years. It is through commitment to my club I have achieved this. In addition I spent 4 years with the sea cadets and marine cadets.
As a Marine cadet I reached the rank of Lance Corporal and in the process gained qualifications in many activities and specialisations. My experiences developed my interpersonal skills and provided me with an ambition to achieve in all that I do.
In December 2004 I applied to gain a scholarship from the Royal Marines, which leads to entry as an officer if I choose to do so. After two tough residential selection processes, at Lympstone and Gosport, I was awarded the scholarship.
I believe I have the qualities required to further my studies as a university student and would cherish the opportunity to build on my existing experience both academically and socially. I feel I would excel in mechanical engineering and look forward to the prospect of a challenge. I see myself as an individual who would not only take from university but also give by contributing to all aspects of university life."
"In the 21st century engineering plays a more vital role in our lives than ever before. As I look around myself I observe numerous devices that were designed and constructed by engineers.
This fills me with a desire to be a part of this great prolific system of creativity and ingenuity.
There are many factors that have promoted my choice of pursuing a career in engineering. Since my childhood I have been fascinated by the mechanism by which devices function. I recall often opening numerous devices to observe the contraptions that lay within.
My fascination has not waned over the years; instead it has been nurtured by the environment that I inhabit.
My father is a computer engineer and many of my uncles have occupations in the field of engineering. Living in the residential camp of a multinational oil company has provided me with ample opportunities to converse with renowned engineers. Through my observations I have noticed that engineers are dedicated individuals that work towards making the world a better place for the rest of us.
At my high school I joined the Physicists' Society and the Applied Mathematics Society. It was through this experience that I discovered my profound interest in Physics and the application of Mathematics to real world scenarios.
To complement this I had a wonderful Physics teacher that enriched my learning experience. Both my physics teacher and my guidance counsellor encouraged me to pursue a degree in engineering as they believed that I had the necessary skills. It was then that I decided that I would certainly enter the field of engineering.
With this decision in mind I began reading numerous scientific journals such as New Scientist, Scientific American and National Geographic to keep abreast of any advancement in the field of engineering. I also took a more profound interest in Physics experiments and found that I particularly enjoyed experiments involving circuits.
I attended two Engineering Education Programs offered by Saudi Aramco that helped me understand more about my prospective career. I worked assiduously and achieved numerous awards such as the Physicist of the Year Award, Advanced Mathematics Achievement Award and the Business Studies Merit Award. I was also the Valedictorian for Grades 9 and 10.
To complement my academic life I have participated actively in extracurricular activities both outside the school and inside it. I founded the Students' Association and currently operate it as the Secretary-General.
As the Secretary-General I organised two science fairs, held numerous debates and initiated a Model United Nations. I addressed numerous speeches to the school and actively participated in debates at the Model UN. I feel that these activities have refined my communication skills. I also learnt how to organise and coordinate events successfully.
I participated in a variety of sports and played on both the school's soccer and cricket team. These sports have shown me the importance of teamwork and allow me to participate prolifically in a team. I hope that my captaincy of the school cricket team and my role in the Students' Association have developed the leadership skills that I will require at university and later in my career.
Along with my interest in reading scientific journals I find reading fiction to be a gratifying experience. I read fiction from various genres, ranging from the works of Charles Dickens to the science fiction of Michael Crichton. I find that reading allows me to utilise my imagination. I also enjoy writing creatively, bicycling and designing machinery.
Although I am applying as an international student I often visit the United Kingdom and believe that I will be able to adapt to life there. As I am taking the most rigorous course that my school offers I feel confident that I will be able to cope with the assiduous work required at university.
As an engineer I would like to be at the forefront of engineering research, advancing the integration of the concepts of physics, chemistry and biology resulting in an amelioration of our daily lives."
"I am very keen to study engineering for my degree because I have been fascinated by mathematical and physical problems since I was very young, being brought up in a very scientific family as the son of a professor of Sunderland University my interest in science has been cultivated willingly.
My parents have inculcated information to me, and thanks to the support and belief instilled in me I have been awarded good GCSE and AS level grades
Having thoroughly enjoyed physics, mathematics and chemistry at GCSE level; I then chose to advance my understanding and took these subjects at AS level along with AS computing. It has helped me greatly to be able to expand my knowledge in them and apply this information to practical activities.
I have developed expertise in problem solving, accurate measurement, observation, record keeping and cooperation in a group, and so I believe that higher education would enable me to further these attributes and interests to a good effect in the working environment, and I believe that I would be a valued member of any engineering team
In year 10, I completed two weeks of work experience at Trinity College gardens. This helped me to adapt quickly to a variety of situations and will help me in office conditions because I needed to get to know the other employees so that I could conduct myself in the most appropriated manor.
I really enjoyed working outside but the work became quite repetitive and I want to be in an atmosphere where there will be a large variety of absorbing activities to take part in
In my spare time I take part of four football teams, of which two of them are competing in a men's league, the other is the college team and I am also taking part in an under 18's team. I play for my local village cricket team, which I have been participating in for three years.
Playing for these teams has helped me to create a very good level of teamwork. In my last season at colt's football I was awarded the trophy of supporters player of the year, and I am the top scorer for the school second team."
"I have always been interested in the way things work. I am always determined to succeed and I feel that this degree will make the most of my skills. I believe that being part of an engineering team will be very rewarding.
I have always enjoyed doing things using my hands and making things, lately been building a remote controlled plane which flew well until the engine stalled and I crashed it on a landing.
For my work experience I went to Messier Dowty, a company specialising in aircraft landing gear. I was placed in the design environment for three days and the worked on modifying drawings of parts, this gave me an insight into the way engineers work and the types of work the job involves.
For the rest the time I spent there was in assembly, building Eurofighter front nose gear, I found this is was very interesting and I learnt how precision engineering was carried out in the industrial environment.
I have a positive attitude towards schoolwork and aim to do the best of my ability. My GCSE results were strong but I have since improved my application to my subjects and have achieved superb AS levels. This has meant I have been able to carry on all four of my subjects to A2. I felt that a year of free periods was a waste of time.
I am studying physics at A-level. I find this very interesting as has helped me gain an understanding of the world and how it works, moreover it has also given me an appreciation of how engineers work. I have learnt how the laws of physics can be applied to real life and work out problems, this has given me a much broader understanding of the world and made it possible for me to understand the many processes affecting it
I have been studying product design at A level and received full marks in the exam. I have a wide knowledge of how products are made and the design limitations involved in manufacture. This will give me an understanding of the limitations in manufacture that an engineer must be aware of when designing a solution.
I also study business this gives me a understanding of how business are run and the chalenges they face and way to I am a good team worker. In year 12 I took part in young enterprise, a scheme that gives 6th from student a chance to set up a business and run it themselves with the aim of enhancing team working skills and making a profit.
I was the operations director in charge of making of our products and distributing them. We went on to be a successful company making over GBP2500, throughout this I learnt how to deal with suppliers and how to negotiate on prices.
I have a job working as a cleaner at school, this require me to organise my time so I can complete all my coursework within the time constraints. I have always been punctual in arriving to my job and have now been working for over a year without a day off, this shows commitment that I am reliable.
I enjoy playing sport, I have played for my school in a number of teams I have played for the tennis team and have won all my games, I have also played for my East Glos my local club and have made it to the semi-final."
"I have always had an interest in the way things work, and since I was young, science has been one of my favourite subjects.
My interest in sciences, particularly physics, has developed throughout my time at school, and I enjoy the challenge of using scientific and mathematical ideas when solving everyday problems.
Last year I took part in the Engineering Education Scheme, working alongside three other students, with the local water company, to work on a project involving the removal of sludge from a drinking water clarification tank.
This helped me to develop time management, problem-solving and teamwork skills, as we encountered several problems along the way (mostly involving the sludge), as well as having to cope with each other for long hours in order to meet deadlines.
I found this both challenging and rewarding, and achieved a Gold Crest Award as well as being able to take part in the regional final of the Young Engineers for Britain competition.
The scheme gave me a useful insight into the types of problems that engineers have to solve, and convinced me that engineering is the career path I want to follow. I aim to secure sponsorship for my course with a local company, as this will provide me with experience of industrial work during the holidays, as well as helping me financially through my time at university
I believe that good links between engineers and businesses are essential for an efficient and profitable future for British industry
Studying Economics to AS-level, along with sciences and maths, has helped me to understand some of the scientific principles behind production and management techniques. Physics has taught me about how things behave, and how these properties can be used in solving both practical and theoretical situations.
Studying biology has helped me to appreciate the role that engineers can play in helping to balance industry and natural environment. My favourite part of the course is the environment module, as I enjoy learning about how different species can adapt to their surroundings.
Mathematics gives me the opportunity to apply familiar concepts to unfamiliar situations, and I enjoy the challenge of solving mathematical problems. I also find further maths enjoyable, as I find it more challenging than my normal maths lessons.
Alongside my school work, I have been studying an Open University science short course entitled ""Food and Health: A Chemical Story"". I enjoy working on the course, as it helps to broaden my scientific reading, and covers interesting topics in more depth than my school studies. It also helps me with my independent study and time management skills. I am due to complete the course at the end of October.
I like to be involved in other aspects of school life, for example I took part in the junior mock trial competition lower down the school.
Last year I was assistant house captain, helping to encourage younger members of my house in competitions. I helped backstage in the sixth form show, which I intend to do again this year. I am a year eight ""buddy"", which involves helping an able younger student with extra schoolwork. I take drama lessons out of school, and recently passed Guildhall Grade 6 solo acting with honours.
I have been involved in five musicals since starting at this school, and am currently rehearsing for my first principal role in the schools' production of ""Les Miserables"". I have also taken part in several productions with local youth theatre and amateur dramatics societies, ranging from William Shakespeare to Willy Russell.
I play the violin in the school orchestra, and enjoy singing in the school choir. I also take part in music activities outside of school, and am involved in groups such as Burton Sinfonia and Staffordshire Youth Choir.
Although at the moment I intend to complete a degree in manufacturing engineering, I do not feel that I am in the best position to make any final decisions about my career yet, and have chosen courses with the first year (and in some cases the second year) common to degree programmes in many disciplines of engineering.
My experiences of engineering so far have been both challenging and rewarding, and I hope that my future career will be too."
"Mathematics and Physics have always been my favourite subjects throughout my schooling career, mostly due to the implications on the real world.
By taking Mechanical Engineering at university, I have the opportunity to continue with these two passions of mine. I have enjoyed carrying out practical experiments which can then be proved using mathematical calculations.
I took part in a Combined Cadet Force (CCF) and specialised in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineering (REME) section. In this, five pupils maintained and repaired old cars then use them to practise driving skills on the school grounds.
This has given me an insight of the engineering behind everyday cars and has increased my enthusiasm to study engineering at university and then possibly begin a career in this field. Over the summer, I arranged for an expert to take me out to see a nodding donkey and explain how they worked. Nodding donkeys are structures used to collect oil from the ground using fairly simple techniques and mechanical gears
Sport has led a major role in my life over the recent years. I have regularly taken part in inter-house matches in rugby, basketball, hockey, and five a side indoor football and represented my school in rugby. I also enjoy running and have taken part in two long distance races, one of which was sponsored and for charity.
Music has also been a large influence on my life as I have been playing the Alto Saxophone since I was nine years of age. I feel music is essential as it can be used to relax from the hectic school days.
There are frequent Political Society and Science Society meetings that I regularly attend which greatly helped me as they expand my knowledge and showed me how theories learnt in lessons were put into practice in real life situations.
I find these societies to be very intriguing because they offer me the chance to talk in depth to experts about subjects that they specialise in and have come to talk at the meetings about, thus broadening my knowledge and interest in the subjects I take part in
As an Upper Sixth House Prefect, I have had to take on many new responsibilities and have learnt a lot about myself. My main role around house as a prefect was to organise chores and jobs that needed to be done. This has taught me a lot about organising things well in advance and making sure everyone can do what they are asked efficiently.
In Lower 6th, I was on a team of seven pupils elected to run a fête during a school sports day. On this committee, I found that much planning needs to be done in preparation for such large scale events and even the smaller tasks needed to be done well in advance
When things needed done, leadership skills came into place to delegate tasks and bring all of the events together. On the day, the seven pupils had to perform under pressure which we did and the fête was a success."
"Having enjoyed science over the years, I decided that engineering was the course I wanted to pursue. The fact that the course will allow me to exercise my mind in a very demanding context appeals to me greatly.
By this, I mean the general method of analysis and approach to problems that Engineering provides is what I am looking for. It is very logical and as a result has an inherent beauty to it when you see that everything in a formulated argument is coherent. My choice to read engineering has also been furthered by New Scientist and more recently STEP physics which have whetted my appetite for further study
I decided to take the IB in order to study the sciences and mathematics but as well to take other subjects in order to continue important skills in English and French.
These skills help communication, which I value as an important skill when working in an Engineering team or in everyday university life. Whilst the IB Mathematics course has proved challenging I decided to follow a Further Mathematics course involving some STEP Maths and Mechanics Four to overcome the lack of Mechanics in the course
Against this the aspect of the IB programme that has appealed to me the most is the practical application of Physics and Maths in a quantitative way. This approach allows us to experiment with situations that are relevant to everyday life and to these situations we can apply the problem-solving skills to improve the situation before us.
Other factors that have influenced my decision to read engineering throughout my school career involve the potential for private research whereby you can discover things experimentally and theoretically
This was achieved, primarily, while carrying out my Extended Essay, which, although in Chemistry, gave me a flavour of what doing you own private research is all about. This is a skill which I feel will be useful in Engineering and one that has given me a good degree of satisfaction in coming out with a good result
The breadth I have gained from taking the IB has been of great importance to me, and I plan to continue with a range of activities that I have picked up through the CAS programme and general interest.
Having been a Petty Officer in the Navy Combined Cadet Force I feel I have been able to enjoy myself but also profit in terms of team building and leadership which I have found to be vital as a School Prefect.
In carrying out responsibilities as a Prefect I have become aware how much time and effort you must put into organising yourself in order to live up to your own expectations and the expectations of others
These skills were put into practice when I partook in the Young Enterprise Scheme. As director of operations and finance, I learnt how difficult it was to motivate workers and keep the production of our photo frames up.
However, again this experience was very valuable and I learnt more about how to run a business as well as a team to a much greater effect than one can be taught in class. Over the past year, I have also played Basketball and fives in the first teams and also run in the cross country team in addition to being a regular attendant of the Defunct Economist Society and more recently the Cultural Awareness Society
I plan to use my gap year as a chance to become a more rounded individual and gain some experience of the world.
In applying to Arthur Andersen for a scholarship I hope to build my teamwork skills and leadership qualities further still before embarking on a trip to France to make myself fluent in French."
"I am keen to study Engineering at University College Northampton because I feel that this HND course will enable me to develop my engineering skills.
I hope that the course will provide a foundation for my advancement in the engineering sector
I am currently seeking sponsorship from the Royal-Navy who encourage students with engineering qualifications to join their team. Upon attaining the necessary qualifications I intend to join the appropriate affiliate of the armed forces as an officer
During the early stages of my third year at college I made the decision to not continue with my studies because I decided that my long-term career was in engineering and that the course that I was taking was of little benefit to my long-term career prospects
A proportion of my spare time has been spent at my local country club maintaining a level of fitness. I frequently visit the golf range and regularly play during the summer months. I have a passion for music hi-fi equipment and records."
"I am keen to study Engineering because I find it fascinating and from an early age I have enjoyed solving mathematical and physical problems:
I feel higher education would enable me to develop these skills further. This subject not only allows me to investigate new technologies but it also gives me the opportunity to develop and focus on one of my genuine interests
My interests have been heightened by the work experience that I undertook at the Metropolitan Police (Operations and Technical Support Unit).
There, I experimented with electrical circuits of products, ranging from small toys to security systems. The time I spent there allowed me to gain a basic knowledge of electronics as well as how the Police operated. In addition to work experience, I have attended engineering courses such as one at Surrey University, which improved my teamwork skills
I have participated in a Young Enterprise Scheme where I learnt about leadership, realistic teamwork and financial constraints in real life business situations.
My role in the production of photo frames for a major fair allowed me to gain a credit in the examination. I have also spent a week on the island of Rum in the Hebrides with a group of students, where I undertook various group activities. Currently, I am involved in the Silver Award of the Duke of Edinburgh Scheme
I enjoy Mathematics and I have attended lectures at the Royal Institution as well as 'Mathematics Masterclasses'. These have helped me in achieving Gold Certificates in 2 of the recent UK Mathematics challenges
Out of school hours, I give voluntary help to the young and the elderly at the community whenever possible.
My hobbies include reading, drawing and playing sport. I read magazines such as Scientific American to keep up to date with new developments in science and technology.
The sports I enjoy the most are squash, badminton and hiking. I also play the piano and have achieved grade 8 standard."
"Having thoroughly enjoyed A level Mathematics and Physics, I would like to further my studies with a degree course that combines these subjects.
My Further Mathematics at A level course has helped me develop the confidence to tackle more chalalaging questions analytically. Whilst A level Chemistry and Computing have increases my basic knowledge in related subjects and will definitely assist me in future studies
I am currently interested in Electrical and Electronic Engineering which I have pursued through my work experience in London.
During the summer I did work experience with The Cellular Investment Company. The company is one of the most successful firms working in the field of mobile communications in Africa, Far-East and South America. This was a valuable experience for the course at University
Both my parent are science/engineering professionals and they taught me some of the qualities needed for a degree course in the field of electric and electronic engineering. This has encouraged me to find out the opportunities available
Outside college, I am a very keen mathematician and have been awarded 2 gold and a silver awards in the last three consecutive UK National Maths Challenge, which is an annual event organised by the Leeds University
I have been a Millennium Volunteer for the last 8 months and I am currently volunteering at Rathbone, at the Merrion Centre in Leeds.
I send 2-4 hours every Tuesday and Wednesday helping people from all over Leeds to achieve all sorts of computing experience from GNVQ's to New Deal Diploma's
I have also just finished my second term as a tutor with Leeds United Football Club. I usually spend two hours a week at Elland Road, helping Key Stage 3 pupils develop their basic skills in literacy, numeracy and IT."
"My choice of career was initially difficult. My interests are widely varied, covering everything from biology to philosophy and from art to technology. I have come to see engineering as a discipline that can satisfy and further develop my interests.
I have enjoyed studying Maths and Physics at A-Level, and this has helped me to refine my problem-solving skills as well as increasing my theoretical knowledge. I am especially interested how maths reveals parallels between separate branches of physics. My studies, and my wide experience of engineering from a work perspective has shown me that my career choice is correct.
Over Christmas 2003, I worked in a cycle shop, dealing with assembly, maintenance and repair. This first taste of engineering as work rather than a hobby whetted my appetite for more.
Every weekend since November 2003, I have worked in the warehouse at a Comet store, where one of my responsibilities is to deal with returned products. Working with faulty electrical goods has shown me first-hand what opportunities for improvement exist across the field.
After finishing GCSEs, I participated in a 12-week training placement at Chromogenex, a local medical engineering firm. The experience was fascinating, and I accepted an offer of employment with the company until I started college, and have been asked to return whenever I am available in the future.
My work at Chromogenex was varied, including production and service, and I was given significant quality control duties. One of my most interesting responsibilities was to write the Work Instructions and Procedures, which production and service engineers will refer to as guidance to ensure that all products are of the highest standard.
In October 2006, I took a week's work placement at a Rhos Designs, a design engineering firm whose main client is 3M. I enjoyed the CAD work, and the chance to take part in real projects, which will soon be put to use at 3M's various sites across Britain.
I also like to use CAD for projects of my own, which recently included drawing up a design for a competition in which I participated. The competition involved planning and designing a home-made potato launcher to a deadline and a tight budget. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and am already working on my next design!
During 2005, I was part of a four-person team working on a project on the EESW scheme run by the Royal Academy of Engineering. The project was an exciting task set by Corus at Trostre Tinplate Works. We were asked to design and build a solution to the problem of split edges in the cold rolling line.
Our solution was effective and economical, and if adopted by Corus, could save the company thousands of pounds per hour, as the line would no longer need to be stopped in order to carry out emergency repairs.
We designed and built a prototype solution, and a mock-up of Trostre's SCADA system to demonstrate the solution's potential. Our project received a prize for 'Most effective use of IT' at the Welsh National Convention of Excellence in Engineering.
Before starting my degree course, I intend to enrol on the YinI scheme, which should give me an in-depth experience of engineering work, and help ground my subsequent studies.
In my spare time, I enjoy computing, and am fluent with several operating systems and specific software packages. I have attended part-time courses in programming, graphics, CAD and Programmable Controllers for my own interest.
Another important interest for me is linguistics, and I intend to continue my study of French to the highest level as well as beginning to learn other languages alongside engineering. For me, studying at this university would be as much about the experience as the qualification.
I believe that engineering is a discipline that will offer me a chance to make a tangible difference in the world, and I am certain I will enjoy the opportunity to fully reach this potential."
"Maths and physics have always fascinated me and from an early age I knew that it was in the science based subjects that my interests and greatest ability lay.
Although I have enjoyed the challenge that my school-based work has given me, I have always sought to extend my knowledge in these subject areas by considering the application of the theory we learn within the curriculum to the real world.
This desire to learn how theory can be applied in real life allowed me to greatly enjoy the mechanics modules of my further maths A-level to such a degree that I knew that engineering would be the ideal subject to study at the highest level.
While physics and maths give one the background skills needed to assure the validity of innovation and technology, engineering seeks to apply this simultaneously with a desire for products to satisfy consumer needs such as efficiency, safety and cost. In this way the skills learnt during my economics A-level would be of great use during a career in engineering.
In June I had the opportunity to spend a week on a Headstart course at Cambridge. The experience gained during the 4 days there which involved both learning theory and practical work, coupled with continued in depth reading of various fields of engineering, have further strengthened my desire to study this subject.
Being a sports person, I am greatly intrigued by the opportunities for the use of engineering in the sporting world. Having competed at county level in javelin I looked into how engineers have developed the javelin over the years from an iron spear used in Grecian times to the 800g carbon-fibre implement used today.
With the javelin, engineers have been forced to sacrifice their desire for an efficient product able to satisfy the needs of athletes with safety. While the athlete wishes to throw further and further, the spectator watching from the opposite end of the stadium also has his own needs!
This example of a u-turn in needs makes me question how much further technology can continue to develop at current rates without the need to make sacrifices itself. I have also captained my school's First team at lacrosse and played for my county. These sporting responsibilities have given me the invaluable experience of participating in and leading a team.
During my school years I have maintained high academic standards while also being able to hold numerous positions of responsibility and I have been consistently involved in extra-curricular activities. The time management skills gained through this will be vital in being able to successfully achieve high standards during a challenging university course.
Over the past year I have taken time to be an assistant sports teacher for young children, while I have also enjoyed the demands of being a form assistant to a first year class at school.
Not only have these positions allowed me to mature greatly, they have also aided my inter-personal skills. Though I hold the certificates of my academic successes I am fully aware that only it is only in combination with my logic, problem-solving and intuitive skills that my scholastic knowledge can be applied most effectively.
During a gap year I am keen to find, through the Year in Industry scheme, a long term placement with an engineering firm. By spending my time in this way, I believe that I will gain a far greater idea of engineering's place and importance in society.
The opportunity to mature and learn key skills will give me a far better stance from which to start a degree course. Aside from working, I am also hoping to travel during my gap year to gain a greater awareness of the world around me through interaction with new people, places and cultures.
ADDITIONAL PERSONAL STATEMENT FOR CAMBRIDGE FORM:
By not specialising in the first 2 years of a degree course, I believe that I would have the best chance to find where my true interests and talents lay in engineering. Though my A-level physics and maths courses have allowed me to begin to think where I would like to specialise, I do not consider that I am currently in a position to make an accurate decision on what area to dedicate my university degree to. The depth of theory into which the Cambridge engineering course delves is, I believe, the most suitable way of learning the subject if one is to be serious about following through into an engineering career. The timetabling of the course at Cambridge would also allow me to continue a large number of extra-curricular activities and simultaneously give me the opportunity to contribute greatly to college and university life."
"Engineering offers us the chance to make the world a better, safer and more exciting place; this is what attracts me to the subject.
I am fascinated by how machines work, and in order to find out more I investigated the basic engineering involved in cars, such as the engine, the powertrain and superchargers.
Following this I explored the principles of flight after we briefly dealt with this topic in physics lessons. I also researched the achievements of engineers such as Brunel and Stephenson, and more recent projects like the Airbus A380 and the Channel Tunnel Rail Link.
Following a university course in engineering, I hope to be able to develop new technologies which would benefit both the people and the planet. I am concerned about environmental issues such as climate change and pollution which are currently facing our world, and hope to use engineering to resolve these problems while also improving people's lives.
Throughout my time at school my interests in maths and science have developed, and I relish the opportunity of using mathematical and scientific techniques to solve real-life problems. In particular the mechanics modules have been very enjoyable.
Studying further mathematics has proved more demanding than I anticipated, but I have found the extra challenge very stimulating. Furthermore, it has shown me the extent to which mathematics is ultimately present in everything, and therefore a career where I could use mathematics greatly appeals to me. The IT-based nature of engineering will enable me to further my experience with computers.
I am involved in school life in areas other than academic. I have taken on increased responsibility in Year 13 as a prefect, and assist regularly at school concerts. I am keenly interested in the world around me: I read the Guardian daily and am also in the Philosophy Club at school, where we have discussed various topics including fundamentalism and the existence of God. I am a keen reader both of fiction and also to learn more about the world.
Music is a key part of my life. I like listening to various styles, particularly rock and electronica. I play violin and piano and have achieved Grade 8 on both instruments.
For seven years I was a member of a local orchestra and choir, and I now play violin in the County Orchestra and a local orchestra. In addition, I am a member of several school musical groups, including the Symphony Orchestra and Chamber Choir. Later in the year I will be conducting the orchestra, which should enhance my leadership skills.
I like to keep active, and enjoy football and swimming. In recent years I have participated in the Swimathon (5000m) to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Relief, and I will be doing this again next March.
At the weekend I work at a local supermarket. This has helped me in several ways - as well as the financial benefits, I am able to work well with other people and my confidence has increased.
Although I have not decided exactly which career I would like to follow, I am confident that the challenges offered by engineering appeal to me and will inspire me to do great things. Engineering has always been vital in developing the world, and is a field in which I would love to be involved."
"From a very young age, I had aspirations of becoming an engineer, because I wanted to build machines that did not require direct human energy inputs to operate.
I achieved this for the first time a few weeks later, designing a vehicle that carried it's energy stored in rubber-bands; it wasn't a roaring success, but the fact that it wasn't perfect only increased my desire to learn more about engineering.
Soon afterwards, I became a serious motor sport enthusiast, and to understand the sport more, I began assisting my dad and his mechanic in the maintenance of our family cars and electricity generator. I quickly learnt and understood the function of every part of the generator and before long, my dad ran out of answers to my questions, like: 'Why do high performance engines often have up to six valves per cylinder when two would do the job?'. He therefore encouraged me to read further about engineering, and a few books later, I knew what I was devoting my life to.
The more I learn about mechanical engineering, the more assured I become that a career as a mechanical engineer is suited to me. A few years ago whilst researching for a physics assignment, I discovered that most cars are 20 to 30 percent efficient at best.
This statistic is unacceptable, and it had a big influence on my decision to study mechanical engineering, with my focus being engine design. In addition, learning subsequently of the rotary engine, continuously variable transmission (cvt), pneumatic and desmodromic valve control, hydraulics and many other interesting concepts has further trengthened my decision to study mechanical engineering, and it is my belief that I really can make a mark in the automobile industry.
After deciding to become an engineer, I set out to find the qualities necessary for success. In the process, I read about Heinrich Maybach, Thomas Edison, Isambard Brunel, Ernst von Siemens, and a host of others. Of all the great engineers I have learnt about, the one that inspires me the most is Thomas Edison. This is because unlike all the others, he not only was talented as an engineer; he was also a brilliant businessman.
I believe that success, as an engineer in this day and age, requires technical competence and a combination of management, leadership, communication and business skills.
Leadership is something that I have naturally and my school recognised this by appointing me a senior prefect, which I believe has further improved my leadership and communication skills. In addition, I recently set up a maths club in my school where sixth-formers who are good at maths help pupils from the junior school with their study and homework. This has improved my communication and presentation skills tremendously.
Reading Robert Kiyosaki's book, 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', taught me the importance of having financial and business skills. To improve these skills, I volunteered at my local British Heart Foundation shop for a few months, to understand how charities make money. This turned out to be a very valuable educational experience.
When I have time outside my curricular and club activities, I am a very enthusiastic sportsperson. My main sporting interests are football and the high jump. Presently, I am in the process of starting up a football team for the sixth-formers in my school, to improve general physical fitness and to foster a sense of belonging among the new sixth-formers in my school.
I am also working towards a sports leadership award. In addition, I am involved in Greenwich council's Gifted and Talented program called 'xtrahot', and I have attended a number of seminars and workshops as part of the program.
It is my hope that a degree from your university would serve as a solid base for a successful career in engineering, where hopefully, I would be involved in the development of new technology for cleaner and more efficient transportation systems."
"Like most engineers, I have always been curious about the functioning mechanisms behind the many objects we use in our daily lives. At school, Physics and Maths have always been the subjects that I find most intriguing and in which I excel.
This has strongly pushed me towards pursuing a career in engineering. Moreover, the inspiration and originality of engineering surfaced manifestly in me at an early age.
This field is one that influences almost all man-made creations and operations, from the enormity of a Yamato Class battleship back in World War II to the minute circuit that powers an artificially intelligent robot to tying a loose bolt on my sister’s bicycle.
Friends and teachers describe me as a logical thinker yet I often find unique solutions to physics problems. In addition, Mechanics components in A-level Maths have introduced problems that require an innovative mind, whilst featuring real and useful applications; these undoubtedly widened my scope, improved my application of Mathematics and increased my passion for Mechanics in particular.
During the academic year, I have been appointed as a teacher’s assistant in subjects like Math and Chemistry, peer-tutoring chapters to younger students in less advanced courses, correcting and assessing their test papers.
My school has recently hosted a shadowing day in which my I and my fellow colleagues sharing the same interests and career aspirations were given a detailed tour of a massive and prestigious new residential compound called “Madinaty”.
This has shown me more about the real operations engineers design and has made me even more confident that I have chosen the field of study that fits me best. I was motivated to develop exceptional computer skills at a very young age.
I acquired the ICDL certificate from Microsoft more than 5 years ago; I have also completed a VB programming course, which hopefully may assist me in computer-aided design courses in the future.
Whilst sustaining a high academic standard, my self-organization has enabled me to participate in various sports, activities and events. I have been president of the student council at my school for the last 3 years and have attended an enlightening leadership conference (ISLC) organized by graduates of the American University in Cairo.
I have been given the chance to develop my teamwork and leadership skills at many fundraising and charity events and at my school’s student council meetings.
In addition, I have taken up boxing and Mixed Martial Arts; I have also participated in a number of local tournaments. I am an active member of a non-profit organization called “Bedaya Men Hena” (meaning “It Starts Here” in Arabic) aimed at educating and enhancing general social skills amongst financially underprivileged children.
Furthermore, I have taken the responsibility to lead the 2013 Prom Organizers team enhancing my time management skills and gaining some experience in the field of event management.
Living and studying abroad is not an easy move, but I believe I have enough motivation and drive to succeed. My results so far in my IGCSE exams and A-Level studies has built my self-esteem, supplied me with a wide set of practical skills, broadened my horizons in many different sciences and provided me with the motivation to study Engineering.
I am confident that this would facilitate my studies and increase my ability to grasp different aspects of engineering. Moreover, I am certain that I will not face any difficulties concerning studying or communicating proficiently in English as I have been accustomed to an English-speaking environment at school.
I believe I am endowed with the initiative and the foundations of the problem solving skills that will enable me to face any academic challenges. I am passionate about Engineering and will embrace any opportunity to develop my skills and flourish in my chosen career."
"It is my ambition to work in the engineering industry and gain ‘Chartered Engineer’ status. Maths and science have always been my favourite subjects and during my GSCE’s physics was something that sparked my interest and has continued to engage me ever since.
While completing my AS courses in Physics and Maths I particularly enjoyed the mechanics units as they allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real life situations which I found fascinating and gave me an appreciation for the way engineers have to think.
My specific interest in mechanical engineering began when I started researching basic engineering principles for a physics project several years ago.
One of the first areas I researched was the fundamental idea behind differential steering. I was inspired to learn more about mechanical engineering by the two TBM’s (Tunnel Boring Machines) that were used to bore a section of the Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland. My interest in learning about these machines and principles was the initial reason I decided that mechanical engineering is the course I want to pursue.
As well as being interested in modern mechanical engineering I was curious about the origins of the subject so I read a book titled 'The Age of Steam, the power that drove the industrial revolution'. this provided me with a great insight in to the lives, motives and inventions of engineers and inventors such as James Watt, Robert Stephenson and Isambard Brunel.
Studying ICT at A-Level has allowed me to develop my ability of coping with and adapting to using many different kinds of software to complete large projects. This is important as I know that using complex software such as CAD (Computer Aided Design) to design systems and complete projects is essential in the modern engineering industry.
The courses I am applying for include an industrial placement after the second year. I believe this will be an invaluable opportunity to put into practice what I have learned during the first two years and gain some experience of what it's really like to work in industry. As well as this, I believe that it will give me a head start once I begin to negotiate through the competitive job market.
Having viewed the modules that are taught during the course, I believe that I will find fluid dynamics the most interesting area. This is because I have learnt a lot about how different forces effect solid objects that do not change shape. I believe it will be highly exciting to learn how these different forces affect both liquids and gasses.
So far, throughout my study in Sixth-Form, I have had ample chance to develop my teamwork skills. This has mainly occurred through my physics course when I have been regularly placed in a group with other members of sixth form and have to conduct research into a certain topic.
As a team we then had to report back our findings in the form of a presentation. I believe learning effective teamwork skills is crucial because engineers from different disciplines often have to work together. For example, the courses I have applied for include a final year project which will require some collaboration.
I think I would be well-suited to student life as I have a range of hobbies. These include reading, cycling and playing the electric and bass guitar, both of which I have achieved a grade 4 in.
I also enjoy watching engineering-related programmes on television such as ‘Mythbusters’, ‘How its made' and 'Massive Machines'. I am also subscribed to several maths and science related channels on Youtube such as 'numberphile', 'vsauce', 'engineerguyvideo's' and 'Smarter Every Day'.
Although I am determined to complete a degree in mechanical engineering, I do not feel I can make any final decisions regarding my career yet. However, the courses I have chosen allow me a flexible path in a very wide field and I hope that my future career will be challenging, stimulating and highly rewarding."
"The ability to apply what I have learnt in the classroom to the outside world is an aspect of physics and maths that I particularly enjoy. An example of this was being able to calculate the coefficient of friction between a book and a table, by knowing the weight and measuring the angle at which it started to move.
Then, using maths, we could model the situation and work out what would happen if the book was heavier or if we changed the angle of the table. This means of practical applications of pure sciences is at the heart of my interests in pursuing a degree in engineering.
Maths has long been a subject that I have enjoyed, particularly the logical approach to problems, applying various techniques to different situations. Further maths has allowed me to develop my ability to tackle problems logically as well as further improving my adeptness with numbers.
Alongside developing my interests in the subject through a better understanding of the processes involved, taking Physics has also given me the opportunity to better my skills in researching and analysing data. I have enjoyed the experimental aspects where I have been able to carry out and devise experiments that demonstrate or make use of the processes that we have been learning about.
My main interests in engineering lie with mechanical engineering, stemming from my enthusiasm for cars and an absolute passion for motorsport. This passion prompted me to take up go-karting as a hobby and provides me with an opportunity to understand the complexity involved in modern machines.
Even with something as simple as a go-kart, very slight changes, such as a few degrees of toe in or minimal changes to the gear ratios, can have very significant effects on lap times and the handling of the vehicle. Another appreciation that I have gained from Karting as well as reading motorsport literature, is that handling of the vehicle is as important as engine power and I believe this idea is relevant in many aspects of engineering where many factors have to be considered.
Another interesting aspect that is present throughout the field of engineering is the intense competition that demands radical thinking and new concepts from engineers in order to stay on top, whether it be to increase efficiency in industry or to make a car go faster!
A fantastic example of this was developed as a result of Professor Malcolm Smith from Cambridge University drawing parallels between suspension systems and electrical circuitry. On realising that suspension systems had no equivalent to a capacitor, he set about developing one. From this concept the ‘J-damper’ was created for Mclaren and it is now used throughout the F1 Grid. This true ‘outside of the box’ thinking fascinates me.
I am currently working on an Extended Project Qualification and I have chosen Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems to be the subject of my project. So far, I have enjoyed carrying out the project on my own and have carried out extensive research including being in contact with the head of design for regenerative system at Williams F1, to act as an expert on the subject.
Last Summer I spent several weeks carrying out work experience, wherein I developed various skills. I spent a few weeks in various departments at a BMW dealership, particularly enjoying my time in the workshop, where I worked with mechanics to diagnose and fix faults on customers’ vehicles.
There I developed team working skills as well as learning a great deal about the vehicles and their systems. I also took the opportunity to develop my communication skills by conversing with customers as they waited to be attended to.
Apart from karting, outside of college, I also practice Tae-Kwon-Do. After several years I have achieved 1st degree black belt and apart from being a way to keep fit, I really enjoy it, have met many people and have used the lessons in discipline to help me succeed in other areas."
"I have always had a creative ability and a fascination with how things work. The challenge of solving practical problems inherent in the field of engineering appeals directly to these traits.
I am particularly interested in electrical and electronic engineering (EEE) because it is such a rapidly evolving discipline. The potential to integrate new technologies into real life applications and the opportunity to develop practical skills in this sphere is exciting.
I spent a week within the Electronics Department at the British Geological Survey and was shown the diversity of the work they undertake. Their job is to use electronics to investigate the properties of rocks using invasive and non-invasive techniques. What most enthused me was the freedom the engineers have to use their creativity to solve problems. I observed them designing their own experiments and using their PCB layout and design skills to build circuits to achieve this.
In addition to my school work I have been studying an Open University science short course entitled 'Inside Nuclear Energy'. I chose this course because nuclear energy is a fundamentally important consideration in our future energy supply.
The module debated nuclear energy from an ethical and practical perspective as well as studying the technology and science involved such as calculating nuclear decay and how a nuclear power station works. Studying this module has broadened my scientific reading and helped my time management and independent study skills.
During my academic career I have been house representative and a member of my school council. I was a member of my school team for the national Bar Mock Trials and reached the final in Belfast. I was elected as a member of the UK Youth Parliament for South Lincolnshire where I was very fortunate to attend Stormont and debate in the House of Commons.
I was the Managing Director of a Young Enterprise group. This role involved managing a team of 10 of my peers and maintaining good relations throughout while ensuring that quality and time management was maintained.
As a team we designed our product and I negotiated with a local manufacturer who produced it using recycled plastic bottle tops. I gained valuable team work and management skills and we won both regional and national awards including one for 'Innovation'.
In my free time I play netball where good teamwork is essential. I play clarinet, guitar and have reached grade five in piano. I enjoy watching talks on TED.com and I keep up to date with Wired magazine which covers current and future trends in technology.
I believe it is important that an engineer has a wider understanding of the social, political and economic issues to better appreciate the context in which engineering impacts on the community it serves.
In economics I have learnt to consider the effect of negative externalities which include the environmental impact of individual companies. I am acutely aware of the need for science to explore ways of harmonising technology with nature. All engineering henceforth will need to consider its environmental impact.
EEE impacts on almost every aspect of our lives today and will only grow in importance. I want to be part of our technological future and make a positive contribution to future developments."
"Understanding and discovering how mechanical products work has always been an interest of mine. When I was younger, I would spend hours building complex structures using Lego or K-Nex which is where my passion for engineering began. At school, this passion for construction and engineering was further enhanced by mathematics and physics.
My enthusiasm for these subjects and their exciting theories is what led me to pursue a degree in engineering. A Boeing 747 with a maximum take off weight of around 400,000kg and to lift off the ground or finding out that the physics incorporated in a F1 car means that it could generate enough down force to ride upside-down, amazes me. Today's advances in technology means the products engineers will be able to achieve in the near future will be incredible.
In 2011 I carried out a week work experience at Rolls Royce, Inchinnan. I observed engineers carry out their work as they processed the new internal fan blades for the Trent 1000 engine. I was shown how the blades were processed and the precision involved.
I was given the opportunity to apply some finishing touches to these, where I had to file down the blade. I noticed that there were various sections within the factory and that it was important that everyone worked as part of the team to meet the strict delivery dates, something that I feel is strength of mine. The week here further increased my interest in aero mechanical engineering and has confirmed that mechanical engineering is the ideal career path for me.
I am a Prefect on three committees within the school: Isobel Mair, Graduation and the Library. Isobel Mair is a local school where specialist provision is given to children who require additional support.
The pupils visit our school and take part in physical education. In addition to this I helped out at the STEM Fair where a selection of Scottish universities and businesses attended. This involved encouraging younger pupils to develop a higher interest in engineering. Whilst showing them the various careers they could undertake in this field.
At university I intend on joining one of the University Air Squadrons, this would help me to obtain my PPL (Private Pilot's license). This would benefit me greatly in my ultimate future career as a pilot. After university I intend on going to a flight school where I will be able obtain my ATPL (Airline Transport Pilots License).
My involvement in football has helped me to develop skills in teamwork. As a team game it is important that every one works together which is also important for engineers, as it allows the most effective solutions to be found. I have also learned to play the piano up to grade 4, where I have achieved two distinctions a merit and a pass.
Playing the piano has helped me to improve my hand, feet and eye coordination. I am a keen golfer and have been a member of Cathcart Castle Golf club for three years where I play regularly.
I currently have a part time job at Asda. This helps develop my interpersonal skills as I work on the shop floor also I have to interact with customers, which also helps further my confidence. I am also finding about important things such as health and safety and working in a corporate culture.
In conclusion I feel I have the right desire and academic skills to complete a degree in mechanical engineering. With both mathematical and problem solving throughout the course, achieving a degree in mechanical engineering would give me the best possible chance to go and achieve my future career goals."
"have always been fascinated by the vast jobs robots are able to perform, and by the way all these cars around us were designed.
The problem is, my interest was not satisfied by revolving around the outer appearance of these machines or by how well they achieved their functions, but was constantly demanding to learn more about how they managed to do so, and what inner complexities I was not allowed to meet closely made it capable of attracting my attention.
Engineering arrived like a wish granting spell, as it combines the two subjects I am very passionate about. Majoring in engineering is going to give me the chance to further dive into the interesting findings of physics and finally put the mathematical knowledge I gained during my A-levels into practical application.
Problem solving is one thing I will be facing during my studying years, and it is the thing I am willing to encounter in order to both, help society, as well as myself. Challenges tempt me so much. I would risk it and make my mind that I should get out nothing but a winner. That is another reason that makes me ready to solve those problems I will face, and certainly, in the most creative ways.
In addition to that, a very important group of those who change the world are engineers. They get to fetch for ways to control and prevent the pollution going on because a greener environment, free from pollutants is what we are all looking forward to. They also create new medicines, explore and develop new technologies. They can try out all the amazing things we thought would only exist in imagination, from flying vehicles to undersea buildings. They are able to get a hold of these wonders and make them the future's reality, and I would be very glad to join them in doing so.
After choosing to be one, I read various pieces of information about engineers that made it to the high rank, success. Among the text I went through, I found Hedy Lamarr, who has affected today's availability of Wi-Fi, Smartphones, and any other wireless technology possible. I honestly regard this as very impressing, as almost all our reliance nowadays is on the result of her creation.
Despite the fact that Hedy had no degree in engineering, she had an idea for switching from a frequency to another in a matter of split-second intervals, and putting it into application was enough to help us reach today's technologies.
In our time, though, I believe that an engineer is not going to prosper if he depends only on the knowledge he graduates with. Every engineer needs to build certain skills including leadership, business adeptness, management, and ease of communication.
Having English as my second language did not stop me from aiming to be a good user of it. I have been attending an English speaking school for thirteen years, and sat for the IGCSE English as a Second language exam achieving an A*. Moreover, I have been to English Summer Programs twice as a young girl.
I believe my stay in the UK will help me get an even better language and accent. In fact, I enjoy learning new languages, and being surrounded by international students from different parts around the world might get me to learn more languages and improve the ones I already know little of.
Not only that, but mixing with students with different backgrounds and talents will be a step forward in being a better participant during teamwork and a good boost to my confidence.
Apart from that, studying in the UK will free me, somehow. I will be more capable of organizing my time without being held back by family obligations. It will bring about a more independent person out of me that can work her way through life with a lot of her own effort.
Finally, I hope that a degree from your university is going to serve as the ultimate base to the journey I am taking to achieve my dreams towards a successful engineering career."
"The art of engineering is applying scientific theories to design. The fundamental principles that are applied to products and structures are paramount and by studying engineering I am hoping to learn how engineers use these principles and then integrate them into designs.
A design that has inspired me is the Falkirk wheel boat lift as it shows how solutions to engineering problems can be imaginative and iconic.
Engineering will allow me to see how principles are applied to design. This was highlighted in a lecture I attended on the mechanics of roller coasters. I was fascinated to learn about some of the design constraints which were applied to balance speed with safety. For example, if a bend is too tight then excessive g-force would cause participants to blackout.
I then applied the idea of using maths in order to ensure the safety of Formula 1 drivers. I used this to assist in preparing and delivering of a number of workshops run at my school for local primary school children, one of which involved the design of Formula 1 cars and calculating the speed at which they can be safely driven and the chance of them crashing.
Attending a Headstart course at Swansea University showed me how the theory that is learnt in the lecture theatres can be easily transferred to a practical application in the labs. A particular highlight was the civil engineering task where we designed and built an inflatable structure with a team.
This is an area of engineering that I am looking forward to studying as there were many different solutions suggested to solve the same problem. This course was a useful experience as it allowed me to see the different teaching styles at university by attending lectures and doing lab work. I found this enjoyable because of its hands on nature.
I have already started to further my knowledge by reading ""How Things Work: The Physics of Everyday Life"" by Louis A. Bloomfield, and I have enjoyed learning the basic theory behind wings creating lift by creating a difference in pressure.
I am very much looking forward to studying this area in greater detail. I have also read ""Invention by Design: How Engineers Get from Thought to Thing"" by Henry Petroski which has shown me that to an engineer, every design can be improved upon and it is this potential to improve and progress things via engineering which strongly appeals to me.
Outside the classroom I have taken part in the UKMT individual maths challenges where I have achieved 3 gold awards, twice scoring highest in my year. This resulted in me representing my school in a team maths challenge. Additionally I have attended events run by the Gifted and Talented Program including a week long summer school and lectures to help further my maths knowledge.
My main hobby is mountain biking and I have been riding regularly for 4 years. During this time I have had to carry out a lot of maintenance on my bike which has led to my interest in how they work and all the aspects of bike development. For example carbon fibre is replacing aluminum as the material of choice for most components due to its ability to improve strength while reducing weight. This interest has led me to taking a course on advanced mountain bike maintenance in November.
I have taken part in many activities that have helped to build my teamwork, leadership and time management skills. I finished the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Award where strong teamwork is essential in order to succeed, especially at the expedition.
I have also represented my year on the school council where I had to demonstrate good time management and organisation skills which I used when I helped to organize an event to help other schools improve their councils. I have played cricket for my school and local team which has taught me to cope well with pressure.
I believe that I have the academic ability, interest and personal attributes that are well suited to studying engineering at university and to pursue a career in this field."
"Growing up, there was one focus that utterly fascinated my young self; automobiles. As a child, it was the more simplistic features of these engineering phenomena, such as exterior design, sheer speed and the roar of the engine that enchanted me so greatly. As much as those factors to this day still captivate me, as I became older and more mature, my knowledge of this subject area enhanced significantly. Before I had even driven a car, I had a solid comprehension of how the heart of the machine, the engine, functioned. Once I had educated myself about this component, I continued my studies and furthered my research into other intricate mechanisms such as the transmission and differential systems. Ultimately, understanding how all of these elements cooperate in harmony, as one body, is what I find most intriguing.
Previously, having no access to motor vehicles, I compromised with contraptions such as bicycles and skateboards. Repairing these became a hobby and I was the person that my friends came to if they had an issue that required mending. Although these apparatuses are more straightforward in design than automobiles, hopefully, higher education will allow me to develop and progress, eventually resulting in a career within the field which I am so passionate about. I have profoundly enjoyed studying mathematics and physics at A-level; my preferred topic in both subjects has been mechanics. However, in GCSE physics, the topic that I enjoyed most was hydraulics. Mathematics has allowed me to further enhance and practice my problem solving abilities whilst physics has enriched both my practical application and theoretical understanding, involving many crucial concepts to engineering.
I hope a degree from your University will allow me to transfer key abilities from a place of study into, eventually, a place in industry. After much extended research, my admiration for the engineering innovator, Karl Benz, has been truly established. Commonly regarded as the originator of the first automobile powered by an internal combustion engine, his contributions to the vast domain that is engineering are simply colossal. One creation of his that captivated my mind tremendously was the ‘Blitzen Benz’; a vehicle fabricated solely for the purpose of speed. Assembled in 1909, this automobile boasted a 21.5L engine that produced 200 horsepower. At a time when the iconic Ford Model T was only generating around 22 horsepower, the pure muscle and craftsmanship that had been put into the Blitzen was enough to achieve a record breaking land speed of 141.94 mph; “faster than any plane, train, or automobile” at the time.
Understandably, I am mindful that the finest engineers must possess a resilient skill-set, which should include the ability to thrive in both collaborative and solo tasks, flourish under pressure and blossom in positions requiring a leadership mentality. Hopefully, a place on this course will allow me to reinforce and augment my previously developed skills whilst allowing me to simultaneously acquire many more essentials abilities that will prove beneficial in later life. I believe that my current accumulation of skills have been gained through my experience in the workplace. Currently, I am employed at The Commercial Hotel and Bar where I am confident that I have improved my ability to communicate with both team members and customers. In summary, I genuinely believe there is enormous room for change in current engineering. The immense amount of finite resources that are being consumed on a daily basis is simply unacceptable. I have faith that young engineers will be the pioneers of more efficient and ‘green’ technologies that may leave our planet in a more inhabitable state for generations to come. Ultimately, my aspiration is to become one these innovative engineers and I sincerely hope a degree from your University will be the supporting basis for this objective."
"My desire to study Engineering stems from the practical application of Maths and Physics to real world situations to enhance and improve them is a field that I find fascinating and perplexing. After partaking in different engineering-based experiences, I learnt how varied and inclusive this subject is, and that is the reason I want to study Engineering at University.
Following work experience at the Centre for Life, I realized I was particularly drawn to its Physics branch. A major part of my experience was talking about STEM topics during the workshops we held for young children; helping to teach Physics principles amplified my passion for learning and teaching how the world works, and this increased my communication skills with individuals of varied ages.
Taking part in the Engineering Education Scheme gave me the opportunity to experience working as an Engineer, as well as achieving the Gold CREST Award. As a team, working with Walker Filtration to investigate an alternative method of attaching their end caps to their media cartridge allowed me to work with equipment (such as an optical pyrometer) not accessible in school. From the Residential held at Newcastle University, a vital aspect I took away from this experience was carrying out experiments after a vigorous researching and planning process. Working on a practical scheme allowed me to understand the importance of project management, teamwork and commitment – skills that cannot be gained solely through A-Levels.
I have participated yearly in the UKMT Maths Challenge, which has increased my ability to think logically in order to solve mathematical problems. From this, I have achieved two silver and two bronze certificates, as well as coming third in the Regional Final of the UKMT 2013 Team Maths Challenge. I have also attended Maths Inspiration Events: most recently in which Rob Eastaway presented “Zequals”, a concept where approximations are often preferred when dealing with very large numbers. However, my interests are not simply limited to Maths; I have attended various lectures, one being a ‘Physics in Perspective’ lecture where Dr. Kate Lancaster presented her work regarding building stars on Earth. After attending these lectures, a topic that particularly resonated with me was the idea of a sustainable future. I am aware there is currently a global issue of a growing population, yet resources are declining, and this is something I would like to explore further, particularly alternative energy sources to non-renewable resources such as crude oil. Moreover, I have participated in the RSC Schools’ Analyst Competition; here I learned how to apply practical skills in a lab and work with substances such as aspirin and analyze their chemical properties.
I took part in the National Citizen Service where, as a team, we worked to complete a project to help refugees in the local community. This experience taught me the importance of teamwork and being the leader of a group when necessary. Currently, I am working towards my Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award. Objectives, such as planning routes and meeting deadlines, strengthened my collaboration skills, time management and organisation. For my ‘Skill’ section, I completed a 6-month online Cambridge Computer Science course, which developed my independent and extra-curricular learning and enriched my wider knowledge of technical processes.
My ambition and desire is to explore the world of numbers, by analysing current STEM issues and researching ways to overcome them. This, along with the transferable skills that I have gained through my experiences, makes me ideal for studying Engineering at University."
"From a young age, my favourite subjects have always been by far mathematics and technology. This is why I'd like to study Mechanical Engineering at university; I will be able to develop my design and mathematical skills and for it to help me pursue a career in this field.
I have an analytical mind and a natural curiosity for finding out about how things work and how they are built. For example, how does a lift manage to move up and down at a constant speed with different load weights? This has led me to look in depth into what load torque is and its relationship with the velocity of the lift. My ambition is to design and create something revolutionary to change the world for the better.
I get a great sense of achievement from solving intense mathematical equations and seeing how they link into the real world. Upon glancing at the equation for centripetal force can seem like it's just a mathematical concept but what interests me, is understanding how this applies to real life situations and how centripetal force can relate to how the Moon orbits around the Earth. However, Mechanical engineering, in my opinion, is more than just completing mathematical calculations and using formulae in the right context. It is the modelling of what the future will become- discovering new technologies and enhancing the way we already live. This to me is the exciting part about engineering as a subject.
I currently study Mathematics, Physics and Graphic Communications at A Level. Throughout studying mathematics in college it has given me a multidimensional view on how the subject is all linked together rather than just following steps in order to get an answer. Physics is a very significant subject within my studies, as it does not only back up my mathematical work but enhances my general knowledge about the world itself and how technology works; from how an x-ray machine works to how the momentum is linked to the speed of a moving lorry.
Also, studying graphic communication enhances my creative side. I like to draw and use more technology based media to develop my work and create professional graphic designs. As the Head Boy of Leasowes High School in year 11 it played an important role in building my confidence. My main responsibilities were to promote the school by speaking infront of large audiences, sometimes up to 400 people at open events. This was as well as setting an example to the rest of the school and delegating roles to the prefects when needed.
I also took it upon myself to become a mathematics and humanities ambassador as well which gave me a great sense of achievement through helping out the pupils in the years below. In school I also took part in a competition called the 'Make it in Engineering' competition, of which we were put into groups 8 and had to follow a select brief in order to design the new car of the future. Using important leadership skills, I managed to coordinate the group and bring us together as a team, in order to design and come up with the bullet car; this was a single person car that could drive through traffic more efficiently than other vehicles- much like a motorbike would. After pitching this concept to a panel of esteemed judges we managed to place first and win the trophy for us and the school.
I currently work part-time as a supermarket assistant in Waitrose in Stourbridge. I complete a variety of tasks and socialise with a wide variety of people from all sorts of backgrounds. I started off as carrying out transactions on the tills but have been promoted significantly and am now a trained partner on the customer service desk. This involves helping customers and other employees alike with issues that they have whether it be with deliveries or general information about product. This is considered to be quite a sociable and comprehensive role within the branch.
I endeavour to create positive relationships with all the customers and some of which I have created in depth and strong relations with."
"I am part of the 6% of care leavers wishing to enter higher education. My journey through education has been testing at times but, as a result of hard work, tenacity and determination, I am ready and eager to commence undergraduate engineering studies and shape my future.
I am a problem solver. I developed this skill at a young age through my hobby as a computer programmer. I completed tasks, such as, making a PHP system talk to a python programme and creating automatic encryption for the files on my computer. I have continued to hone this skill during my research concerning the mechanics of drones and the different concepts such as weight distribution. More often than not engineering concerns solving problems in order to design, construct and operate mechanical systems. I feel that I possess this vital skill that will enable me to tackle my studies with zeal.
I developed my interest in engineering by watching a YouTube channel by engineer Colin Furze. His videos consist of projects where he constructs contraptions, such as, a giant swing whilst relaying the building process. These videos provide insight into the engineering mentality, how to collect resources for a project and the art of effective communication. Colin’s thermite gun was, by far, my favourite project! Furthermore, for some time, I have played an engineering version of Minecraft called Voltz. This game involves different teams of players building bases and engineering advanced technology such as ICBMs, force fields, teleporters and space travel. Here I experienced the satisfaction that comes with completing a project.
More recently I experienced engineering disciplines in a university setting. At Southampton University, I attended ‘Isaac Physics’ events where teaching involved advanced Maths-like vectors, differentiation and circular motion in order to find the motion of planets around a solar system. I gained a real appreciation for the importance of maths and physics in an undergraduate setting and beyond.
In addition, I was accepted onto the University of Cambridge ‘HE+ programme’. Here I learned about Mandelbrot sets, group theory, dimensional analysis and how many cups of tea an atom bomb’s energy could make! Not only this, in April 2017, I attended a University of Cambridge Maths Masterclass. I attended lectures in applicable and theoretical maths, including cryptography, proof by induction and axioms of maths. This experience taught me that, at University, I will prefer my studies to include the application of theoretical maths to real life situations.
I consider that I will make a valuable contribution to University life. At college I have participated actively in extra curricular activities. As a member of the debating team I represented my former college in a competition involving local colleges successfully winning the debate ‘Should the government privatize the NHS?’. The ability to analysis a problem is essential in many aspects of daily life and I relish the challenge to refine this skill.
Secondly I was a Care Ambassador for Hampshire Country Council which involved being the focal point and advocate for children in care. I met regularly with a variety of people including senior managers in order to discuss concerns and pragmatic solutions. This role involved supporting other young people in order to help them remain in education. This role has inspired me to go to university.
Finally I was an LGBT ambassador at my former school where I helped facilitate an environment where people could feel comfortable. This involved working closely with other students and senior management in order to implement procedures that addressed bullying. It was by far my proudest contribution to my school.
Going to University to read a demanding subject, such as engineering, is particularly significant for me. It is a challenge that excites me and one that I intend to approach with enthusiasm and a robust work ethic."
"After completing my final year of secondary school, I had finally realised my academic strengths and weaknesses, as well as the subjects I enjoyed the most. I felt that I exceeded at mathematics and the sciences, mostly due to my curious nature and ability to draw logical connections that many may not see. Because of this, it was natural for me to study Maths, Chemistry and Biology at A level.
I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in sixth form, and I have discovered that my favourite parts of my current subjects include the study of Mechanics and any practical work in Chemistry and Biology. As Mechanics combines Physics with Maths this has really helped me to appreciate the application of Maths in the real-worId, reinforcing my interest and helping me to develop a broader array of skills in the subject. In both Chemistry and Biology I've loved doing practical work since year 7 as it allowed me to see for experience how all of the theory behind reactions and biological structures accumulate into things we take for granted today. My interests now lie in the real world applications of these subjects.
I have found the theory behind these subjects intriguing, whichis why having the opportunity to study in any of these areas at university is so appealing to me. Another part of university that I'm excited for is the added independence I'll have. Free periods felt natural for me, as it allowed me to study and better understand the parts of my subjects in which I was weaker in. I also look forward to meeting like-minded people at university, as I look forward to being around those with similar aspirations and interests as me. One aspect I'm interested in are the societies, as I enjoy a range of sports and hobbies, such as rugby, fitness and running.
At my current school there are no official clubs or groups for these, making it difficult to pursue any team based sports. However, there were a few opportunities at my school to take part in extra-curricular activities, such as Vic Medics. This was a weekly biology related club where we would do a weekly dissection on various organs and animals, gaining a better knowledge of anatomy in addition to that taught in the classroom. I feel that studying any of my preferred subjects at university will open up many options for the careers I want to get involved in.
I have also participated in multiple academic competitions, such as the county based quiz called ""Top of the Form"", ran by the defence company BAE, which followed the same principles as the television program of the same name. Eight schools in Cumbria participate, and I was in my school's team in both year 10 and year 11, where we came 2nd in year 10 and got to the semi-finals in year 11. During my work experience at secondary school I attended a week at the engineering company Siemens, where I constructed deep sea cables alongside the permanent workers. This helped me to realise my potential to pick up practical skills with relative ease and the confidence to tackle new tasks independently.
More recently, I have worked part time as a waiter at a local hotel (Lakeside Hotel, Cumbria), where I gained experience in independent working, tackling new challenges daily, keeping composure under stressful customer-facing circumstances and most importantly a developed sense of priority and time management. I am eager and enthusiastic about studying at university and realising the many opportunities and challenges it brings."
"Engineers build societies. More specifically, mechanical engineers apply fundamental maths and physics laws to construct mechanical devices that we use every day, despite sometimes going unnoticed. For this reason, I would like to pursue a career in engineering, as it is such a key component in societies. It combines my fascination of how things work and the mechanics behind devices, with the ability to apply maths and physics concepts to real-life situations.
Studying Maths Mechanics at A-level has given me experience with calculus and more advanced mathematics, including differential equations, creating a firm grounding for the mathematics I should encounter at degree level. Physics has given me an understanding of fundamental notions and reinforced the mechanical aspects of maths, while through Chemistry I have gained hands-on practical experience through regular experiments. Economics at AS level allowed me to develop knowledge on economic practices, as I recognise that many engineers move on to positions involving management responsibilities.
Being invited to partake in the A2 British Physics Olympiad enabled me to gain a deeper understanding of physics principles including Newton’s Laws of Motion and the Laws of Thermodynamics, especially those entwined into everyday tasks. Participation in the Physics Olympiad also provided me with the means to develop my critical thinking skills, as there are usually multiple paths which can be taken to reach the same answer. In addition to this, it required me to think logically about a problem while also being creative. Over the summer holidays, I had the opportunity to undertake masterclasses offered by the University of Liverpool, where I was able to enhance my practical problem-solving experience and apply familiar concepts to strange and unfamiliar problems. One of the masterclasses was engineering movers & shakers, where we engaged in a group structure building task and learnt about the levels of stress structures can withstand. To broaden my engineering knowledge I conducted personal online research, with youtube channels Engineering Explained and Learn Engineering, partnered with regularly assisting my dad in repairing and restoring old Land Rovers providing a wealth of knowledge. Here I have been able to develop awareness of underlying concepts within motorised vehicles, such as the differential which allows the wheels to rotate at different speeds while transferring power to both wheels through the use of the spider gear. Allowing for two different types of rotation and so creating variable power output to the wheels.
Last year, as part of the Welsh baccalaureate I volunteered at my old high school’s maths department, where I tutored a group of year 11 students guiding them through the additional maths course. This was beneficial as it allowed me to develop my interpersonal skills, as I had to alter my teaching approach in order to convey the content as effectively as possible to suit each individual student. Completing the Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award has meant I have gained valuable skills including teamwork, leadership and confidence, allowing me to work with a diverse range of people, this is useful as an engineer because you will encounter and have to work alongside various types of people to achieve common goals. In my spare time, I joined a rowing club for several months, demonstrating my commitment and organisation skills as we often trained multiple times per week including early mornings, together with communication skills as team cohesion is an important factor when being part of a crew.
Studying mechanical engineering will allow me to contribute to new life-changing technologies for numerous industries; including construction, transport, and health-care. My motivation and diligence along with my ability to study independently will make me as I believe it an asset to the course."
"Born in a war-torn country, I was not used to seeing buildings with complex structures. Migrating to the UK introduced me to a new world. 4 years old, when I first came to Manchester, driving by the Beetham Tower and I could not take my eyes of it. It stood out because it was different and unique. I look not only at a building's exterior beauty but also imagine how the interior structure might be developed. Although it takes a team to bring an idea of a building together and make it reality, there must be that person with a creative spark to give meaning to it, the Architect.
A few projects in Manchester have taken my interest, one of them being Urban Splash. It's an organisation that builds affordable homes around Manchester and other cities. They restore old buildings while respecting its environment. Another project is the £200 million blueprint that former footballers Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville want to bring to life. It consists of two bronze skyscrapers that will include luxury apartments. Although this sounds like a great idea, there are environmental concerns as it will strip away some of the city centre's history. Having done work experience last summer at BDP, a major international practice of architects, designers, engineers and urbanists, I have never been so sure that architecture is the right path for me. During the week experience, I learned that you must align your interests with your clients. This means that you must be a good listener, have good teamwork skills and to be understanding. I am studying 3D Design, Mathematics and Physics as my A-levels. 3D design will help me work on my ability to create an effective and clear portfolio. Mathematics and physics will prepare me for a course in architecture, as they are both challenging subjects that both require problem solving. Physics will strengthen my ability for the engineering side of architecture. The development of these skills will aid me through university. I have taken part in NCS, which strengthened teamwork, communication and learning to live on a budget. I have also completed the Manchester Access Programme, which welcomed me into university life and put me into the shoes of a university student.
In High School, I tried to take part in as many enrichment activities as possible. I was a member of the year 8 and year 9 'Debate Mate' teams, the school football team (attending weekly practice and participating in tournaments, Manchester United foundation from year 7 to year 10 and school Handball team in year 10. I also represented my form in basketball and football inter-house tournaments every year; winning football inter-house for four years. Engaging in these has strengthened my leadership and teamwork skills because to play competitive sports with a desire to win, you need to motivate others as well as yourself. Now I organise football, tennis and basketball sessions with friends every week. In my free time, I like to exercise. Play football, basketball and tennis weekly with friends allows me to release stress but also learn. Organising these allows to me maintain a social life which is important. These sports are competitive and require strategic thinking to win. I also go to the gym four times a week.
At home, I try to read as much as I can: fantasy fictions, biographies, and business novels. Reading and taking notes of useful quotes allows me to gather as much knowledge as possible. Art and music also takes up a lot of my free time. My lifelong ambition is to become the greatest Architect, which is possible because I believe human creativity has no limits. I know that this course is one of the longest courses but because of my love for architecture, I want to start this new chapter of my life. I will bring an unmatched work ethic to this course."
"My interest in engineering began after a visit from The Bloodhound Project at my secondary school. The brief talk we received on the aerodynamics, engine and braking system of the car left me wanting to find out more about the world of engineering. I reached a conclusion that engineering required a wide combination of skills ranging from, attention to detail, communication, scientific and mathematic ability. I believe that the skills I have obtained through academic and extra-curricular experience have served well as a magnificent foundation by giving me the confidence to work excellently under pressure and in a group.
During Year 12 Physics we covered the topic Forces and Motion where the maths behind physics is deeply explored. I was distinctly struck by projectile motion, as when you see an object moving, it may seem simple and uncomplicated, however analysing and understanding how and why the object moved in a certain direction and at a certain velocity was very interesting learn about the prospect of being involved with the engineering behind automobiles. I set out to find the qualities that are essential for becoming a successful engineer through reading about Nikola Tesla, Gustave Eiffel and many others. Amongst all these great engineers, Isambard Brunel inspired me the most. This is because although his projects were not always successful, he was often able to solve other long-standing engineering problems through innovative solutions that could be applied to these other problems.
Becoming a major Formula 1 enthusiast really took my passion for engineering to another level. The speed F1 cars are able to reach is palpable and the fact that the aerodynamics required for the cars to generate the downforce to perform at this speed, is designed and built by humans inspires to be involved in such a project. I read an article which delved deep into a Formula One team and explained the importance of all the engineers involved. Each team contains on average 3,000 engineers, working on just two cars, this stood out significantly for me as it put into perspective how complexed the smallest components on an F1 car are such as the steering wheel. Work experience with Costain and Skanska introduced me to the demands involved in the field of engineering. Having a positive attitude and a good relationship with colleagues proved very important in sustaining a strong workforce under high pressure. Observing and shadowing the engineers helped me understand the dexterity involved in a job like this. Witnessing the business aspect of engineering enlightened me on different dimensions involved with being an engineer. Being introduced to clause 31 and 32 left me wanting to learn more about the business aspect of engineering, so to do this I read ‘Business and commercial aspects of engineering’ by John Hunt where he explored ways in which business and commercial considerations affect manufacturing, product design and quality assurance. I played in my secondary school’s football and rugby, as well as a football team outside of school and, have occasionally captained my team, where I have realised the importance of a positive mentality, creative and innovative thinking to achieve the goal set.
My extra-curricular activities in and out of school have enhanced my ability to lead a group. I joined stem club at the beginning of year 12 and this has contributed to the improvement of my problem-solving skills which has helped me significantly in my maths modules and physics. I am currently working part-time at Brands Hatch Race Circuit. I play the piano and am currently working on towards grade 6; piano allows me to improve my thinking skills on the spot. My schedule is very busy and challenges me to manage my time carefully making time for all aspects. I am always challenging my own understanding and I believe that I have the right attitude, skills and personality for this degree. I feel that a career in engineering will make good use of my strengths."
"The first time I was exposed to the work that goes into software development was when I had the opportunity to shadow a WorldPay employee, on the release day of a software project that had been worked on for several years. It provided me with an insight into the programming ecosystem and was the point where my interest in the fundamentals of computer science was sparked.
This interest inspired me to study Computing at GCSE, where I discovered the complexities behind simple processes, motivating me to progress onto Computing AS. I thoroughly enjoyed studying vector graphics, fascinated by how my calculations brought about 3D shapes using a software called Processing. The combination of subjects I study at A2 contribute to my analytical, experimental, statistical and programming potential; undoubtedly the skillset most sought after in the field of Computer Science. The study of logic and arithmetic is captivating as it creates challenging questions with unequivocal answers, encouraging me to partake in the Intermediate UKMT Maths Challenge where I achieved a gold certificate. To expand my knowledge surrounding concepts of Maths within Computing, I read “The Pattern on the Stone” by W.D Hillis. It changed my perspective on Boolean logic by introducing me to unconventional computational ideas; the most thought-provoking being the applications of abstraction. It was fascinating to see how our brain instinctively uses abstraction to break down tasks the same way a CPU functions.
Furthermore, I am currently teaching myself Java object-oriented programming and Python using online resources such as Lynda and CodeAcademy. I believe this will well prepare me for the programming modules on the course, as well as the independence required at University. I have learnt how to build PCs for myself, family and friends, which has strengthened my practical ability and knowledge on how operating systems work with different components. I successively created a Hackintosh posing many challenges requiring me to troubleshoot. This developed my ability to break down a problem and solve it efficiently.
Alongside studying, I have worked with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, an investment bank, where my group was tasked to pitch a unique idea for a mobile app in a Dragon’s Den scenario. I volunteered to lead my group, whereby communication and teamwork were essential. Using the leadership skills I had developed during the National Citizen Service programme, my team claimed victory over forty others. Furthermore, I worked at FremantleMedia where I provided technical support to clients and shadowed the Technical Manager. I had to create a PowerShell script that fetched logs from clients which meant I had to learn the basic syntax for an unfamiliar language in order to develop a solution. This required me to meet a specification and a deadline, strengthening both my client communication skills and my ability to work under pressure. In addition, I assisted an IT Technician in a school enhancing my on-the-job training skills by learning to draft a new network; an unfamiliar process that is transferable to software design.
To give back to my local community, I volunteered at a Food bank for several months, assisting with the organisation and collection of various food items from the neighbourhood. This boosted my time management skills by challenging my ability to meet deadlines under meticulous conditions. In my free time I enjoy digital photography and cinematography, providing a real-world application of Maths and Computing whilst combining elements of art and creativity; essential for a software engineer.
The perplexity of the future surrounding this field is what keeps me motivated to develop my understanding and put my mathematical ability into practice. I wish to be at the forefront of research in the fast-paced and unprecedented field, that is, Computer Science. Who knows what innovation may lead to in 10 years’ time?"
"Picking apart game files and understanding their composition was an enjoyable way to spend my time while growing up. It ended being something I spent an extensive amount of time on. This experience made me especially interested in how games were created and how the code that made up the backbone of every major game was written.
Taking Computer Science at AS level was an enjoyable experience that has improved my knowledge in programming. I learnt how to write efficient procedural programs during the course and that knowledge inspired me to try creating small programs for my own computer. In my own time I learnt how to write small shell scripts (.bat files) in Windows that allowed me to easily execute groups of programs at once rather than open each program individually. Subsequently, I added a time delay to these programs and end said programs when the console instance was closed. This boosted my productivity immensely: I no longer have to dig through my computer for obscure programs I rarely use.
Maths and Computer Science complement each other very well and knowing this fact drove me to begin learning some of decision maths since it is the one of the most relevant AS level Mathematics modules to Computer Science. I found algorithms, such as Dijkstra’s Algorithm, particularly interesting because they have useful real-world applications. I learnt that maps could be represented as weighted undirected graphs, with the weights representing distance, vertices representing locations and edges representing roads between them. This allows the algorithm to be used to find the shortest distance between two locations, likely the single most used feature of all current navigation software.
Outside of college, I have deepened my understanding of programming by partaking a Hackathon held in Google’s Soho Office UK. We pitched a completed concept for an application on the Play Store and the winners received the funding and guidance to actualise their concepts. I was tasked with creating the front-end which was done using HTML and it was an experience that not only informed my decision to pursue Computer Science at a higher level, but provided me with the drive and planning skills to do so. I will be refining the web-based development knowledge gained at that event as I complete computer science coursework, it will also involve the creation of an e-commerce website for my mother. Another hobby of mine is building computers for friends and myself. For me, putting the hardware together to make a fully functional computer is a rewarding experience and I look forward to learning about the software interactions involved.
Taking Computer Science at university will provide me with practical tools that will prove vital to a career in game development."
"Studying computer science is an exciting life-changing experience, offering me the opportunity to discover the important strategies, used in the computing sector. A strategy is extremely crucial to progress in computer science. What makes computer science so interesting is it has a huge impact on the entire World. In this digital age, every industry that exists requires a computer scientist. Problems with industries are often solved by computers. Resolving these issues requires people that can pay attention to detail and luckily I possess this skill. This suggests that my character is effortlessly suited to a career in computer science.
Currently, I am studying A levels in Maths, Economics and Chemistry. All these subjects have given me a strong knowledge foundation for a degree in computer science. Studying Maths has given me a logical way of addressing real-life problems. For example, using probability to predict the outcome of any situation. While studying Economics, my self-confidence and communication skills have flourished. Constantly having to convert my complex economics models into qualitative data and present it to my whole class. Chemistry has developed my research skills, which I believe will come in handy when studying in University.
For my year twelve work experience, I worked for a small laptop and computer repair business, where I helped fix the laptops and computers. I found it so fascinating and interesting to see computers work and how essential they are to individuals and businesses. I am a member of the Codeacademy and Udacity website and a frequent reader of the Computer World. Doing this allows me to improve my programming and coding skills, getting familiar with the programming language and keep up to date with current affairs in the computing world and gain knowledge from respected computer scientists. Recently, I attended a Computer Science taster course at London South Bank University. This taster course amplified my passion for studying Computer Science at University.
Helping out at Parents Evening and Open Days by registering and ushering the parents and providing tours around the school to parents and potential students who have taken a liking to the school. This provides clear evidence that I am a dedicated team player. Taking advantage of all opportunities that my sixth form provided.
I currently have a part-time job, working as a customer service assistant. Working in Waitrose is developing my numeracy skills through handling cash and balancing the tills at the end of the day to check we are meeting targets by carefully counting all the cash in the till. Spending time on the till has improved my computer skills.
In my leisure time, I enjoy swimming. Travelling is also a passion of mine, so far I have visited countries in Europe, Middle East, Asia and Africa. I plan on visiting different countries across the world as I am quite fond of exploring different cultures. I am a teaching assistant at the Sunday school in my church, my responsibilities are helping the teachers to plan lessons and managing the behaviour of the children. Trying my best to help others when I'm presented with an opportunity to. I peer mentor young students between the ages of eleven and fifteen. Giving me an opportunity to be a positive role model and develop and maintain relationships with the young students.
Computer science is essential as it plays a huge role in everybody's lives. I am excited to broaden my understanding of computer science. My experiences in life have shaped and prepared me to study Computer Science at University."

"Nowadays, we mostly rely on technology and computers to strive and advance in fields such as artificial intelligence, script writing and programming to make our lives easier.
Due to our need for technology, there is a high demand for programmers. This in itself being one of the biggest reasons I wish to become a computer scientist. As well as coding in my free time, my studies have also supported my decision to start coding. A-Level mathematics topics such as Boolean logic and arithmetic have driven me to explore coding further. I am especially proud to have achieved a Best in Year certificate in the UK Senior Mathematical Challenge in 2016. I have also taken part in the 'CIPFA in the Midlands 6th Form Management Team Game' in June 2017, which has helped me prove my management, teamwork, debating and mathematical skills, me being assigned an accountant role in the team. Through my further education, I have acquired many essential transferable skills. In maths, I have learnt to synthesise information from different topics to solve a problem. In science I have demonstrated I can condense large areas of study into essential pieces of information and then expand using my own knowledge. This will set me in good stead for tackling extensive reading lists and information garnered from lectures at university. The practical assessments in physics and chemistry have demonstrated to me the value of teamwork and the importance of taking other people's views into consideration, which will come to my aid during seminars and tutorials during at university.
Outside of school, I have been learning Java using the website 'SoloLearn.com'. I know most of the basic commands in Java and I am comfortable with putting together small pieces of code. I have also conducted research into the usefulness of Ruby, SQL, Python 3 and HTML, and have come to the conclusion that I would like to study Python 3, due to its general popularity amongst programmers. As I am trilingual, I find language-learning comes naturally to me, and this will help me with the above. I believe that this course's career prospects are future proof. My goals regarding career are to become a website designer or a game developer which I think are at a great search as the technological era is in continuous expansion.
In my opinion, the world is in need for fresh young minds to expand this digital world furthermore; plenty of companies that operate online are very successful which makes the internet a great tool for people to develop businesses which has no boundaries for operators such as distance on the globe or having to go to a place to work. During the rest of the time, I like going to the gym, enjoy long walks in the park and listen to music. I am an EU student and I have chosen to come to study in the UK because of the good reputation and prestige that UK universities have to offer. I am accustomed to the UK school system and environment since, leaving Romania, I have successfully completed year 11 and 12.
In short, I am a technology enthusiast and am keenly interested in starting a computer science degree which will give me the required knowledge and qualifications in achieving my career goal to be a programmer. I am positive that with your contribution, I will fully succeed with my passion for programming languages in my choice of profession."
"Computer science is a vast subject, covering many topics that I am interested in, and of all fields it has the greatest implications for the future of society. It is also a very practical discipline, offering near limitless potential with what can be achieved using increasingly powerful technology. My interest in computer science began from me being curious about the components of video game consoles, leading to me building my own PC. I also took part in a computing club in school in years nine and ten where I developed game making skills in Scratch using pragmatic and creative thinking. Artificial intelligence is without a doubt the area of computer science that I am the most fascinated by, because it will allow us to achieve feats immensely more impressive that were ever possible before, but also has the potential to be the most disruptive force to the global economy in human history. I have learnt more about this aspect of AI from reading The Economic Singularity by Calum Chace, which has made me appreciate the importance of computer science in the world even more. Within the broad topic of artificial intelligence, I am particularly interested in Google Deepmind and self-driving cars because these are continuously resulting in exciting developments that can change people's lives. Rather fittingly I get most of my information about technology from the internet instead of books, using sites such as Reddit and Ars Technica to stay on top of news about advancements to do with computing.
Mathematics is fundamental to everything about computer science, from simple sums to complex algorithms such as Bayesian optimization. I am very confident that I will be able to work well with advanced mathematics because I have a high attainment in maths and I enjoy solving complicated problems. I am able to pick up new concepts in maths quickly and gain an intuition for how they work and how to apply them to different situations. This skill would be very useful to learning about computer science, because mathematical concepts, like being able to prove that algorithms give the correct outputs for a range of inputs and programming a machine to be able to quantify and analyse massive amounts of data, apply to many interwoven areas of computing and require a high level understanding of the mathematical foundations of these procedures.
During my time in sixth form, I have completed AS Level Computer Science, meaning I already have experience studying this subject which would be useful going on to university studies. I currently take A Level Physics because it involves learning more about how the Universe works on a macro and micro level which I am always curious about, and it involves using a lot of maths. Additionally, I am studying Cambridge Pre-U Economics. Economics is similar to computing because it is based on applying maths to real world situations in order to model issues and find solutions, such as calculating price elasticities to suggest the optimal actions for a business to take.
Overall, I believe that I would be an excellent computer science student because I am great at problem solving, which is integral to being able to perform well in computing. For example, I achieved two silver certificates and one gold certificate in the UKMT senior maths challenge, showing I can solve abstract problems effectively I have had to solve real world problems in my Duke of Edinburgh Gold expedition, which also shows I have useful teamwork and organisation skills. Due to computer science being the subject I have the most expansive long-term interest in, I would like to be able to study it at a top-level university so that I can learn much more about the field and work towards a career in computing with a revolutionary company such as Google, so that I can be a part of the largest economic era of innovation humanity is currently and has yet to experience."
"The world of computing is constantly evolving from the creation of the top new Smartphone to the development of new multi-platform applications used worldwide. My interest in computing began in primary school through the medium of coding. Starting with languages we created in order to have secret coded conversations in class. Soon after this we attempted, and unsurprising failed, to learn and incorporate Morse code into classroom conversations. This interest advanced further when I became acquainted with the video game industry, realising that code provides the building blocks in order to create things. The book ""Code"", written by Charles Petzold, helped to solidify my understanding of the fundamentals of Computer Science, giving an insight into the evolution of programming. I found the transition between using switches to enter binary data into memory, to discussing high and low level languages over the space of just two chapters particularly interesting. This leap exemplified the speed and huge extent to which programming has advanced in recent years. Human-computer interaction is a subject that fascinates me. It creates a bond between Psychology, which I am studying at A-level, and Computing. Another aspect I find engaging is the progression of Human-Computer Interaction from people using no GUI at all to the growth and use of virtual reality more recently.
History A-level has provided me with critical thinking skills that will be essential in tackling problems faced during my studies, and has also helped develop my writing skills. Producing an essay involves careful, sophisticated planning, analysis and synthesis. This will carry over into computer science as it involves solving difficult problems systematically, and effectively turning theory into reality. Studying Psychology, particularly in regards to producing psychological reports and conducting studies, has provided me with leadership and teamwork skills which will help me with group working in a Computer Science degree. Taking Computing at A-level has taught me the foundation of computing, as well as the principles of object-oriented programming and computational thinking. The subject has also given me the freedom to reinforce my programming skills through the teaching of VB.NET along with several sorting and searching algorithms. I wish to study Computer Science as it will allow me to apply the skills I have learnt in my current studies into real life scenarios; giving me the ability to hopefully create systems that people will use in their everyday lives.
Outside of schoolwork I am an ardent gamer. Along with sparking my interest in programming, gaming also led me to building my first PC when I was 13. This advanced my knowledge in the hardware of computers after spending hours researching different components, while I saved the money to buy the parts. More recently, I built a 3D printer with my friend as part of a college project he took part in. This was a certain step up from putting together a computer and I hope to proceed with similar projects in the future. I am currently also in the process of creating a program in VB.NET related to my job as a coordinator for a motorcycle recovery company. The program involves the management of recovery jobs with SQL integration. SQL issued in order store the data from customers, the job and staff at the company. This project has helped strengthen my programming capabilities, teaching me new skills as well as refining the basics.
This project has also showed me the importance of perseverance when programming after having to restructure my entire database when running into, what seemed to be, a rather trivial problem. The feeling of overcoming these problems vastly outweighed the stress of finding them in the first place, further fuelling my desire to create more. I believe that studying Computer Science will allow me to develop the skills I will need to pursue a career in the computing industry."
"It was my father who played a key role in igniting my interest in computing when he showed me MSWLogo and Basic early on. It is now programming that sparks my interest; it is the way my mind works and I am invariably thinking about how real-life situations can be turned into a program. Studying Computer Science as an A-Level has provided me with a structured learning environment that augments my self-learning and I am excited about developing this further at university.
Ethem Alpaydin's 'Machine Learning: The New AI', has opened my eyes to the idea of using data to construct programs without explicitly doing any programming, by utilising the patterns in such data so that an analyst doesn't have to. However, according to Gartner's 'Hype Cycle', it is also believed that we have reached a ""peak of inflated expectations"" and that it is no longer possible to develop much further. A reason for this could be the narrow nature of specially trained algorithms, however, this pessimistic viewpoint represents to me that computing is constantly evolving and there will always be innovation for me to be interested and involved in. Through Alpaydin's work, I have also discovered the world of neural nets, inspired by the neurons and synapses in our own brains, which has pushed me to attempt to use a neural net in my A-Level Computing coursework as a form of AI, and I have been amazed by its ability to overcome the issues found in traditional rule-based programming. I have also taken to reading Google's developer blog, in order to perceive the practical applications of machine learning, while also keeping up to date with the current advancements. Currently, I am doing research on Kotlin and various other JVM languages to better understand the underlying layers a programming language can have, such as the Java Virtual Machine and how sophisticated the building of a language can be.
My dad brought me into his work in the summer of 2015 so that I could experience the career I so badly want to pursue. I was asked to design the UX of a dummy app, despite not knowing how to how to write Android apps. This is the type of challenge I yearn for and having to learn something completely new in order to deliver a quality product was especially rewarding. In my ardour, I delivered a functioning product for the company and not just a design. I'm still working for the company on a part-time basis and we are currently developing a new app, which is being tested and demonstrated to clients for use in production. Through this experience, I had the chance to work with a team and learn how an office environment functions in terms of a software engineering setting. Deadlines are now a force of habit.
I've entered UKMT Maths Challenges over my years at my secondary school, receiving a range of certificates from bronze to gold. I believe this exhibits my love for maths as subject and as a passion. The computational thinking that you learn from maths is invaluable. In order to test myself, I have entered the UK Bebras 'Computational thinking Challenge' and I thoroughly enjoyed the art of problem-solving that it presents you.
I am also a School Prefect, which gives me opportunities to help the school by doing certain duties. This has developed my leadership skills considerably, as I've needed to intervene when certain situations have arisen. As part of an outreach programme, I've taken maths clubs for primary school children, which has definitely helped improve the effectiveness of my communication. I also enjoy playing video games, particularly when viewed from the perspective of how they are created and designed.

I believe that further education in the world of computing can allow me to innovate and create while being at the heart of what I think our future will be like. I particularly look forward to learning about AI and how we plan to tackle the challenge of improving its practical application."
"I wish to study an IT and Computer related course as I believe both of these subjects will provide the basis for me to progress into a career with great potential.  I am a hardworking, ambitious young man who is looking forward to the many challenges that University will bring me.
I believe the use of IT are the foundations of major businesses and help them to grow and develop. With the improvements in technology businesses are always looking to strengthen their IT systems to enhance their performance and efficiency. I hope to develop my existing skills and knowledge to become a successful computer technician.
Currently I am studying Level 3 Business and IT Double Award. These are my favourite subjects because I am a huge enthusiast of IT and Business. I have learned the key components of a computer system and how each components works within the system. This knowledge would allow me to consult others and possibly support individuals or businesses to upgrade their IT operations.
Computer development has been a part of my life since an early age. During my childhood I would enjoy developing and constructing technology devices. Learning kinetically about new and advance technological equipment sparked my interest in the subject. My interest rapidly developed through my education at school, these experiences combined with my Business acumen has strengthened my desire to study these subjects at a higher level.
Presently I am learning about the history of computer technology. This was part of my assignment to acknowledge how our society has changed the way we use computers.  To reinforce my knowledge I recently attended a trip to the Centre of Life to learn the history of gaming, computers and IT systems. I was able to use and assess the quality of the computers equipment, nowadays modern day laptops have 1.9GHZ speeds and 1TB RAM  of memory compared to a 30 year old, Commodore 64 which is a  8-bit home computer with a 1.023MHz processor, 64kb RAM memory, 320×200 display output, 16 colours with a weight of 1.8kg, a basic 2.0 Commodore GEOS operating systems and an estimated of 10,000 commercial software which are specifically designed for this computer including office applications, games and development tools. This visit allowed me to gain the knowledge on how technology improves within the years and learnt me about the different parts of computer system. Attending university will offer me the opportunity to gain more experience and learn about computer information and systems.
When I was in year 11 I secured a week’s work experience at Sainsbury’s, my role was to interact with the customers, insure the shelves were frequently stocked and to help the cashiers. This experience was great as I was able to work as part of a successful team and the job allowed me to take on additional responsibilities. I learnt the importance of being reliable, trustworthy and excellent customer service. During my time there I developed my decision making and communication skills. I also realised how important their IT system was insuring the smooth running of the business. There main IT system at Sainsbury’s was the barcode scanners because each item has a unique code to clarify the right product and price that the company have listed on the till monitoring screen. This also takes into consideration stock control and informs the company of how many items the store has sold.
In my spare time I like to play seven a side football weekly at my local Sport Centre. I enjoy keeping healthy alongside the socially interaction of playing sports with my friends. We also visit the cinemas to watch the latest films. As a football fan I attend all of my favourite football team’s home games.
I am a highly motivated individual, thieve under pressure and capable to work in any circumstances, that involves in my subjects and I always give my 100% because I am determined to do well in my future career and to have a satisfied life that I deserve."
"The layman looks at a graphical interface to interact with their computers and never stops to question the development behind it. When I found out that the fundamentals of computing were written in binary base 2 number system composed by simple 0s and 1s, I was astonished and began to understand more and my curiosity in mathematics began to broaden. Building my first few programs using C++ gave me a glimpse into the possibilities of programming and how effective they are at making processes more productive and efficient. Using Visual Basic, I created an E-bay fee calculator and a basic calculator. From building these programs I found that at the element of programming, true understanding, mathematics is fundamental. During that period, I realised that if I wanted to learn more I needed to dedicate my time to computing and mathematics which is what motivated me to apply for Computer Science.
My interest in computers has led me to attend lectures and open days held at UCL and Imperial College London including “What is Quantum Computing?” By realising some indecipherable problems as well as prospects for the future, my desire to bring that future into the present increased. For a long time, computing has been set according to Moore’s Law; the number of transistors doubles every two years. I am enlivened to see that a destined alternative path may slow down or even stop that pace for a number of years. While studying mathematics I was able to develop a logical thought process that I applied to ICT and biology. I have been able to interlink these subjects to gain invaluable analytical skills. Also, through independent studies I have been able to learn a substantial amount on networking basics. These skills combined allowed me to apply what I have learnt in my own home.
One of my more recent projects of them has been running a NAS and virtual Windows on the same machine using UnRaid. Thus not only giving full performance in Windows, using Cinebench as my benchmark, but also allowing full access to network storage at any time. I was fortunate enough to go on a school trip to CERN in Geneva and I was able to grasp how vital computing is to interpret data, through logical computation and statistics. The terabytes of data that is collected needs to be processed and stored, this requires high levels of networking skills to be able to set up. In July of 2015 I was able to secure a work experience placement in the Product Design and Development department at Sky where I was given responsibility for setting up Sky Box racks used in automatic testing. This allowed me to understand how computing is used in a working environment and how they have implemented an ADGILE work flow which allows them to work better as a team and contribute to making a better product. What struck me the most was the emphasis on direct communication between colleagues, every morning a staff meeting was expected where progress was discussed. I appreciated the amount of time and patience it takes to develop award winning software for hardware that is more than 5 years old; the same patience skills I gained from my own projects. In my free time, cooking and baking creative desserts for the family has always been a favourite. It allows me to explore my creative side as well as allowing me to further improve my problem solving skills when something goes wrong.
In addition, I play basketball regularly with friends where I find this an excellent stress release. Throughout the past two years I have seen how computing and mathematics play an important role in our everyday life and within a decade alone it has revolutionised not only the computing industry but the way we learn altogether. I will not only be equipped with the skills necessary for a successful career in Computer Science, but also be surrounded by people who share the same interest as myself if I study Computer Science."
"Computers themselves, and software yet to be developed, will revolutionize the way we learn.” – Steve Jobs. This one quote, is something that makes me want to be educated, and educate others through the uses of technology. If it wasn’t for the era I grew up in, I wouldn’t be as grateful for today’s technology as others are today. From the earliest moments off my life that I can remember, I was always amazed by computers. I vividly remember the joy I got from using my Dad’s PC for he first time at the age of 3 years old. Ever since that day I have been hooked. From Nintendo, Playstation, Xbox to PC’s, I have been gaming and enjoying the brilliance of today’s technology all of my life. An education in Computer Science> was something I dreamt of from a young age. To be able to study a course that not only interested me, but I genuinely enjoyed was all I wanted. I am currently studying Computing and IT in Gower College Swansea. Last year I complete my A Leel in Graphics, I feel that this course has helped improve both my creativity and design thus complimenting the visionary skills needed when studying my current A level subjects. Outside of my graphics lectures I enjoy creating my own graphical designs as a hobby including designing logos for teams which compete inside of eSports. Unfortunately, my previous school did not quite have the up to date technical facilities to really allow me to explore computing as far as I would have liked. However, during my time at college I have no had access to such equipment and I am thoroughly enjoying the opportunity to really expand my horizons.
Computing has definitely made me more aware of how higher education works as I am constantly having to carry out my own personal research in my spare time to help aid me. My problem solving skills have been influenced the most by this course due to the coding which I find very challengingin some stages, but very rewarding when itis solved. My IT course relates to the subject I wish to study also. From Networking to how Teams within ICT work,I have really been enlighted as to the world of IT and how it plays such a functional, extensive and essential part of many elements of life.
In my spare time, I like to help students with less knowledge on the course develop their skills during workshops within College. I find this extremely rewarding as I am able to pass on what I have learned to help others as well as sharpening my own communication skills I am a very outgoing person and love to become the best in what I do.
I am very interested in Astronomy and really enjoy watching documentaries, going to events and even star gazing in my spare time. I would really enjoy working in the space industry when I am older within the Computer Science side of things.
Another hobby of mine is gaming, this is one of the factors which lead me to becoming so interested in Computer Science. I am currently in a team for the game Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I have watched the Counter Strike franchise grow over the years and I have always been amazed by e-sports and everything surrounding it. I have attended 1 LAN event for Counter Strike with my team and we are also very active with online tournaments. I feel like Counter Strike has given me the opportunity to meet many great people who I can now call friends, from all over Europe. I believe that e-Sports and my activities in them help me learn to talk and meet with people from all over the world who are interested in the same things as me, I would also, in my future, love to work on creating and designing games and I feel that my huge interest in e-Sports would help me with this.
Overall, I feel that I am an extremely hardworking and creative person who wants to challenge myself in the future. I hope that studying Computing in University will help strengthen my knowledge of the subject and find me a successful career in the future in a field surrounding my topic."
"Innovation has always been something that I strive to achieve. We live in a world where it feels like we have the answer to everything and the majority may be content with that; however, I am not the majority. For as long as I can remember I’ve wanted to pursue ‘the next step’ or be held responsible for ‘the next big thing’, and I feel that the passion I hold for computers equips me with the tools I need to achieve that goal. In the future I don’t want to be remembered as someone who was inspired by him/her I want to be the one who inspired; for this reason, I have never wanted to become the next Steve Jobs or the next Bill Gates instead I want to become the first Omar McNish.
From an early age I’ve wanted to pursue a career within the computing industry. Computers have always given me a platform to emphasise my creativity and increase my general knowledge. In my spare time I often create programs in python from scratch; testing out new functions or combining old ones gives me a good opportunity to see my own progression as a programmer. Given the ever increasing technological breakthroughs we see in everyday life I’m fascinated to see what the future holds. Whilst studying my A-Levels I’ve been able to make links between my subjects, giving me a deep understanding of the fundamental ideas of computing. What I enjoyed most in computing is the challenge involved in problem solving. For coursework I developed a behavioural management program for the behavioural team and loved the opportunity. Being able to program in my own creative space was a great experience, letting me improve my ability whilst giving me the constant reminder of the passion I hold for the subject. I cannot wait to take my programming endeavours to new heights and look forward to seeing how my skills improve in the future.
My A Level courses have been an important part of my life. Not only did I find them intriguing but they have been greatly responsible for opening both my observational and judgemental thought process’. Psychology especially, which has given me a new perspective on how I approach predicaments everyday. I can easily benefit from the comparisons I can make between computer systems and behavioural processes of human beings. After learning about the theories of monumental psychologists such as Milgram and Eysenck I’ve been able to incorporate various theories into my general mindset, whether that be a real life situation or a hypothetical academic one. In the summer of 2014 I decided to take ‘NCS The Challenge’. Allowing me to meet new people NCS forced me push myself to the limit, one example would be the 6-hour mountain hike in Wales. Living in university accommodation was another of my favourable moments allowing me to manage my organisation skills and put my cooking skills to the test.
Overall doing NCS was one of the best choices I’ve ever made and wish I could do it again. I have held several part time jobs. My most recent position has been working at BHS (British Home Stores) as a sales assistant, which I started in July. Working at BHS allowed me to improve my skills; for example my interpersonal skills with the public and working under pressure. As well as allowing me to develop new skills such as negotiation skills when pushing sales.I was recently offered the role of floor manager a challenging, role which I can’t wait to tackle. My hobbies include going to the gym regularly to stay in shape, which enables me to keep a focused mind whilst also relieving stress. I also play in a rugby team as a forward it as it gives me the constant reminder of the importance of teamwork. From my university experience I hope to meet new people from different cultures whilst becoming more independent. I cannot wait for the opportunity to surround myself in the subject I feel so passionate about next year, and look forward to the challenges that university will bring."
"This subject interests me because I am always using computers and have been using them from such a young age and I own many different computer interfaces from desktop computers to tablets and I enjoy using them. I think I’m suitable for this course because I have a passion for computer programming.
The only skill I have for coding is taking part in a course called ” An Hour of Code” on a website called code.org. They teach you the very basics of programming and how enjoyable it could be to program. I am very creative, calm in stressful environments, and a good problem solver. My maths is good and I enjoy maths a lot, I also enjoy challenging myself.
I have worked as a Teaching Assistant at my old primary school for work experience when I was studying in Secondary School, preparing documentations and presentations for senior staff.
After I complete the course, I wish to work in software engineering. By using the knowledge gained from this course, such as learning to program and use a programming language such as JavaScript and work with successful major companies such as Apple, designing software and applications is what I want to do.
The current course I am studying is BTEC extended applied Science Level 3.
I am a hardworking and highly motivated individual as I ensure that I keep all my assignments up to date and ensure they are submitted on time. I received mostly merits and distinctions on my assignments during the first year of my course. I received a Merit in Unit 8 which was mostly maths and statistical analysis. 
My attendance is excellent, showing I am motivated as I always attend college to learn and gain more knowledge. Assignments are always in on time ensuring that I never miss the deadline for the assignments and done to the best ofmy ability showing how hardworking I am. I am also a multilingual, able to speak two additional languages fluently (Swedish and Luganda).
I was born in Sweden and lived for eight years then moved to the United Kingdom but travelled back to Sweden throughout my childhood visiting my eldest sibling, childhood friends, and other family relatives.
The first time when I used a PC, it made me become more intrigued to see how these interfaces function, the technology behind computer interfaces and the philosophy of how they function. I would like to learn how software is developed. I think that it’s astonishing to look as the advanced transformation of technology shapes society; there is such a great amount to still be discovered.
The universe of computing is developing at an incredible rate each day, computers are the most influential and widely used tools in our lives. As I would like to think nothing on earth can gauge the exponential development and energy software industry, which I wish to be involved in, especially Software Engineering.
I am aiming to concentrate on a processing related subject as I feel that computers are extremely important in all occupations and ordinary life. In the course of recent years, I have added to an incredible enthusiasm for software engineering, programming advancement, and the IT business. I have a strong enthusiasm for processing and computer interface related frameworks and innovation.
At a young age I used to appreciate dismantling things to perceive how they function, and my enthusiasm for computer interfaces peaked especially when I was young, as time went and new innovation was produced by significant organizations, for example, Apple and Microsoft."
"My fascination with technology was sparked when, as a child I thought it would be a great idea to take apart my Playstation console. Aware of the danger, I was still eager to see how it all worked inside. I find it intriguing how fast society has been shaped and continues to be, by the influence of Computer Science. A few years ago if someone were to have claimed that cars would become autonomous, people would have doubted them. Now we are at a stage where nearly anything is possible and this is due to the relentless problem solving of computer scientists. The latest software update released by Tesla motors allows their cars to learn how to drive themselves, and is an example of artificial intelligence, a sector which I am most interested in. I want to study Computer Science because I want to gain the knowledge needed to be able to help find solutions to world problems, with the efficient use of computer technology. With the knowledge and skills, I will attain from this course, the creative ideas that I could bring into fruition would be endless. I hope to become one of the computer scientists who adapt technology to help the human race evolve. One possibility would be for artificially intelligent gadgets to recognise different people and adjust to their individual needs based on personal preferences. I have been teaching myself Objective-C syntax in my spare time and have completed online programming courses, which have allowed me to explore the endless possibilities that computer science can bring to the world. I have also learnt to create a simple iOS game using Apple’s syntax called ‘Swift’, in XCode alongside Photoshop.
I understand that computer science is not just about programming and hardware but also about the ethics entailed in the process of a design as well as innovative thinking. Studying A-Level Philosophy and Ethics has given me an insight into many ethical situations that may arise around computer science such as the creation of artificial intelligence. This raises controversy of whether or not we should be trying to create artificial intelligence, as people have different beliefs and faiths. One example of such controversy was during the development of Honda’s Asimo robot when engineers had to visit the Vatican to seek permission to continue the project due to how human-like the robot was developed to walk. During a week of volunteering on NCS I visited Wazoku, the creators of an idea-sharing software used by major corporations such as Waitrose and The BBC. I was given an insight into the working environment that I hope to join after completing my degree. I am applying for work experience at Wazoku, in order to learn about how the software industry can influence the progress of companies.
I am constantly seeking to learn new skills and gain experience from various activities. I have been a member of the RAF Air Cadets for four years, where I have learnt many valuable life skills such as discipline, leadership, charity and confidence. Alongside these life skills I have gained various qualifications such as The St. John’s Ambulance Youth First Aid qualification and Leading Cadet qualification. Being a cadet also involved doing charity work such as raising money for the RAF Benevolence Fund and the Poppy Appeal. Through all these experiences I have learnt how to work with people from all walks of life, different backgrounds and people who have different beliefs and ideas to the ones I do. This has enabled me to adjust my approach to solving different problems and situations.
Technological advancements take place around us everyday, from the evolution of bulky antenna phones into smart phones to the introduction of smart virtual assistants such as Apple’s Siri, Google Now and Windows’ Cortana. I am inspired by the fact that computer science has become a fundamental element in the development of a better, smarter future for our world and my goal is to be part of that development process."
